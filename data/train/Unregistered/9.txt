  SEC v. Kenneth A. Dachman, Scott A. Wolf and Stone Lion Management, Inc., 1:12-cv-00821 (N.D. Illinois).  SEC CHARGES KENNETH A. DACHMAN FOR ORCHESTRATING A MISAPPROPRIATION SCHEME AND OFFERING FRAUD  On February 6 , the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Glencoe, Illinois resident Kenneth A. Dachman with misappropriating over $1.8 million in investor funds and making false and misleading statements to investors in offerings for three companies for which he was the Chairman &#8211; Central Sleep Diagnostics, LLC (Central Sleep), Central Sleep Diagnostics of Florida, LLC (Central Sleep Florida), and Advanced Sleep Devices, LLC (Advanced Sleep).  The SEC also charged Scott A. Wolf and his company, Stone Lion Management, Inc., the brokers for the three offerings, for their roles in selling unregistered securities to investors.    Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the SECs complaint alleges that between July 2008 and June 2010, Dachman raised at least $3,594,709 from investors located in 13 states and 12 foreign countries on behalf of Central Sleep, a purported provider of outpatient diagnostic sleep studies.  Between December 2008 and April 2010, Dachman raised an additional $567,399 on behalf of Central Sleep Florida, a purported expansion of Central Sleep into Florida, and Advanced Sleep, a purported provider of medical devices.  According to the complaint, Dachman made numerous misrepresentations to investors in each of the companies, including misrepresentations about how their funds would be used and his academic and business backgrounds.  Dachman also failed to tell investors that he misappropriated at least $1,875,739 of their funds, over 45% of the total funds raised.  According to the SECs complaint, among other things, Dachman used investor funds to rent-to-own a 10,000 square foot home, to pay for family vacations to Alaska, Europe and elsewhere, to purchase a new Range Rover, books, collectibles and antiques, and for personal expenses and credit card bills.  Dachman also diverted investor funds to a tattoo parlor that he co-owned with his son-in-law.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint further alleges that Wolf and Stone Lion acted as unregistered brokers in selling unregistered securities to investors without qualifying for an exemption from the SEC&#8217;s registration provisions.  The SEC alleges that Dachman violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and that Wolf and Stone Lion violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and penny stock bars.    Wolf and Stone Lion each have agreed to settle the SEC&#8217;s charges without admitting or denying the allegations against them.  Wolf and Stone Lion have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.  Wolf also has agreed to pay disgorgement of $335,216, prejudgment interest of $16,268, and a penalty of $20,000, and to be barred from participating in an offering of penny stock for one year.  The proposed settlements are subject to the approval of the District Court.  The SEC thanks the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Northern District of Illinois and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their assistance in this matter.
