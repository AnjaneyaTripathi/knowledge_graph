"  SEC v. Jorge Gomez and Roberto Aleph Espinosa (United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Civil Action No. 1:12-CV-21962  SEC CHARGES TWO INVESTMENT ADVISERS WITH FRAUD  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Jorge Gomez, an investment adviser formerly located in Dallas, Texas and Mexico, with perpetrating a fraudulent scheme to misappropriate millions from an investment advisory client (âClientâ). The SEC also has agreed to settle related charges against Roberto Aleph Espinosa, a former resident of Miami, Florida, who, in conjunction with Gomez, provided investment advisory and brokerage services to the Client.  In the complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, the SEC alleges that&nbsp;in 2007, Gomez, age 42, the president of Atlantic International Capital LLC (âAtlanticâ), lured the Client, a Mexican national, to invest $10.8 million with him by making false claims about his affiliation with two large financial institutions and the Clientâs proposed relationship with those entities.  According to the SECâs complaint, Gomez misappropriated at least $4.3 million from this Client between September 2007 and December 2010. Gomez concealed his misappropriation by providing the Client with fake account statements and securities certificates. Gomez also sent correspondence to the Client misrepresenting, among other things, his ability to withdraw money from his account.  The SEC alleges, among other things, that Espinosa, age 37, the president of now defunct Florida corporation Aleph Consulting Group LLC (âAlephâ), and Gomez invested approximately $3 million of the Clientâs funds in the ACG Global Fund, Ltd., a hedge fund started by Espinosa and managed by Aleph. Aleph received retrocession fees in connection with the purchase of certain securities that were not disclosed to any of the hedge fund investors, including the Client.  The complaint also alleges that Espinosa forwarded to the foreign financial services firm holding the Clientâs brokerage account scores of withdrawal requests signed by Gomez directing the Clientâs funds to Gomez controlled accounts, while simultaneously failing to discuss Gomezâs depletion of the account with the Client in breach of his fiduciary duties.  The Commissionâs complaint charges Gomez with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rule 10b-5(a), (b), and (c) thereunder; and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (âAdvisers Actâ). The complaint charges Espinosa with violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. The Commissionâs complaint alleges in the alternative that Gomez aided and abetted Atlanticâs Advisers Act violations and that Espinosa aided and abetted Alephâs Advisers Act violations. The Commission is seeking permanent injunctions against Gomez for violating or aiding and abetting the violations of the above provisions of the securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest, and civil penalties. Espinosa has agreed to a settlement with the SEC, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, that includes a permanent injunction against future violations of Exchange Act Section 15(a) and Advisers Act Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) and Rule 206(4)-8, disgorgement of $855,000 plus prejudgment interest of $34,822.15 and a one-time civil penalty of $130,000.  The Commissionâs investigation is continuing.   SEC Complaint   &nbsp;  http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22376.htm     Home | Previous Page Modified: 05/29/2012",
"  Securities and Exchange Commission v. GLR Capital Management, LLC, GLR Advisors, LLC, Geringer, Luck &amp; Rode LLC,  John A. Geringer, and Relief Defendant GLR Growth Fund, L.P., Civil Action No. 12-02663 (U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, filed May 24 )  SEC CHARGES NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FUND MANAGER IN $60 MILLION SCHEME  On May 24 , the Securities and Exchange Commission charged an investment adviser in Scotts Valley, Calif., with running a $60 million investment fund like a Ponzi scheme and defrauding investors by touting imaginary trading profits instead of reporting the actual trading losses he had incurred.  The SEC alleges that John A. Geringer, who managed the GLR Growth Fund (Fund), used false and misleading marketing materials to lure investors into believing that the Fund was earning double-digit annual returns by investing 75% of its assets in investments tied to well-known stock indices like the S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones.  In reality, Geringer&#8217;s trading generated consistent losses and he eventually stopped trading entirely.  To mask his fraud, Geringer paid millions of dollars in &#8220;returns&#8221; to investors largely by using money received from newer investors.  He also sent investors periodic account statements showing fictitious growth in their investments.  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint filed in federal court in San Jose, Geringer raised more than $60 million since 2005, mostly from investors in the Santa Cruz area.  Geringer used fraudulent marketing materials claiming that the Fund had between 17 and 25 percent annual returns in every year of the Fund&#8217;s operation through investments tied to major stock indices.  Although the Fund was started in 2003, marketing materials claimed 25 percent returns in 2001 and 2002 &#8211; before the Fund even existed.  The marketing materials also falsely indicated a nearly 24 percent return in 2008 from investing mainly in publicly traded securities, options, and commodities, while the S&amp;P 500 Index lost 38.5 percent.  The SEC alleges that Geringer&#8217;s actual securities trading was unsuccessful, and by mid-2009 the Fund did not invest in publicly traded securities at all.  Instead, the Fund invested heavily in illiquid investments in two private startup technology companies.  The rest of the money was paid to investors in Ponzi-like fashion and to three entities Geringer controlled that also are charged in the SEC&#8217;s complaint.  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, Geringer further lied to investors on account statements that falsely claimed &#8220;MEMBER NASD AND SEC APPROVED.&#8221;  The SEC does not &#8220;approve&#8221; funds or investments in funds, nor was the Fund (or any related entity) a member of the NASD (now called the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority &#8211; FINRA).  Geringer also falsely claimed that the Fund&#8217;s financial statements were audited annually by an independent accountant.  No such audits were performed.       The SEC&#8217;s complaint alleges Geringer and three related entities violated or aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges the defendants violated or aided and abetted violations of  Section 26 of the Exchange Act, which bars persons from claiming the SEC has passed on the merits of a particular investment.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint names the Fund as a relief defendant.  The complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, and other relief.  Geringer, the Fund, and two of the GLR entities consented to the entry of a preliminary injunction and a freeze on the Fund&#8217;s bank account.    The SEC&#8217;s investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Robert J. Durham and Robert S. Leach of the San Francisco Regional Office.  The SEC&#8217;s litigation will be led by Sheila O&#8217;Callaghan of the San Francisco Regional Office.  The SEC thanks the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Northern District of California, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and FINRA for their assistance in this matter.

"  SEC v. Stephen H. Guth, Civil Action No. 1:12-cv-00842 (RBW) (D.D.C. filed May24 )  Stephen H. Guth Settles SEC Insider Trading Charge Concerning Omrix Tender Offer  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled civil injunctive action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that Stephen H. Guth violated Section 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14e-3 promulgated thereunder, by buying Omrix Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. common stock ahead of a November 2008 public announcement that Johnson &amp; Johnson, Inc. was making a tender offer for the outstanding shares of Omrix stock. Guth, a U.S. citizen residing in the United Kingdom, is a self-employed consultant and had been the Chief Financial Officer of Omrix from 1996 to 2000.  The Commissionâs complaint alleges the following: On October 3, 2008, after Johnson &amp; Johnson had taken substantial steps to commence the tender offer, Guth received an unsolicited communication from the Chief Executive Officer of Omrix requesting assistance with due diligence questions pertaining to transactions that occurred while Guth worked for the company. In October and November 2008, the Chief Executive Officer of Omrix had additional communications with Guth related to due diligence questions. As a result of his communications with the Omrix CEO, Guth learned that an acquisition of Omrix was likely, and he purchased 7,000 shares of Omrix common stock. Guth purchased Omrix securities while in possession of material information relating to the tender offer, which he knew or had reason to know was nonpublic and had been acquired from an officer of the issuer whose securities were to be sought. On November 23, 2008, Omrix and Johnson &amp; Johnson jointly announced the tender offer. Thereafter, defendant Guth tendered his shares of Omrix stock, realizing profits exceeding $60,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissionâs complaint, Guth has consented to entry of a proposed Final Judgment that would enjoin him from future violations of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3 thereunder, order him to disgorge $63,517, with prejudgment interest of $7,695.49; and impose a civil penalty of $31,758. The proposed settlement is subject to the approval of the district court.

"  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Mark F. Spangler and The Spangler Group, Inc., Civil Action No. 2:12-cv-00856 (U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, filed May 17 2012)  SEC CHARGES SEATTLE-BASED FUND MANAGER FOR SECRETLY DIVERTING CLIENT FUNDS TO HIS OWN START-UP COMPANIES  On May 17 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Seattle-based financial adviser and his firm with defrauding clients by secretly investing their money in two risky start-up companies he co-founded.  The SEC alleges that Mark Spangler, a former chairman of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, funneled approximately $47.7 million of client money into these private ventures despite representing that he would invest primarily in publicly traded securities. Spangler served as chairman and CEO of one of the companies, which is now bankrupt. Such risky investments were inconsistent with the investment strategies that Spangler promised his clients and contrary to their investment objectives.  The U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Western District of Washington also announced parallel criminal charges against Spangler.  According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in Seattle, Spangler raised more than $56 million from his clients since 1998 for several private investment funds he managed. Beginning around 2003, without notifying investors in the funds, Spangler and his advisory firm The Spangler Group (TSG) began diverting the majority of client money into two private technology companies he created. One of the companies received nearly $42 million from the funds before shutting down operations. It had long been a cash-poor company with a history of net losses, generating less than $100,000 in revenue during its 11-year history. Yet Spangler continued to treat the funds as the companyâs piggy bank.  The SEC alleges that Spangler also did not tell investors that TSG collected fees for âfinancial and operational supportâ from these companies, which were essentially paying these fees with the client money they had received from the funds. Therefore, Spangler and his firm secretly reaped $830,000 from the companies in addition to any management fees that TSG received from clients.  According to the SECâs complaint, Spangler concealed his diversion of client funds for years. He disclosed it only after he placed TSG and the funds he managed into state court receivership in 2011.  The SECâs complaint charges Spangler and TSG with violating, among other things, the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties.  The SECâs investigation was conducted by Karen Kreuzkamp and Robert S. Leach of the San Francisco Regional Office with assistance from Michael Tomars, Peter Bloom, and Christine Pelham of the investment adviser/investment company examination program. Robert L. Tashjian will lead the SECâs litigation.  The SEC thanks the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Western District of Washington, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Internal Revenue Service for their assistance in this matter.  # # #   SEC Complaint   &nbsp;  http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22371.htm     Home | Previous Page Modified: 05/18/2012",
"  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Frank Lynn Blystone, United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, Case No. 1:12-CV-00774 LJO (GSAx) (May 10 ).  SEC CHARGES FORMER OIL COMPANY EXECUTIVE WITH INSIDER TRADING   The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against a former executive at a Bakersfield, Calif.-based oil and gas production company for insider trading in his company&#8217;s stock using confidential information received while he was the CEO and chairman of the board.   The Commission alleges that Frank Lynn Blystone received e-mail updates prior to his March 5, 2010, retirement from Tri-Valley Corporation that contained confidential information about the company&#8217;s ongoing efforts to raise capital and problems it had encountered in a securities offering.  Based on the non-public information he received, Blystone liquidated stock he held in a brokerage account shortly before a Tri-Valley announcement on April 6, 2010, that it had entered into an agreement with six institutional investors to sell its securities at a deep discount from the prevailing market price.  Blystone avoided losses of approximately $36,000 when the company&#8217;s stock price fell 38 percent after the announcement.    Blystone has agreed to pay $75,000 to settle the Commission&#8217;s charges without admitting or denying the allegations.  According to the Commission&#8217;s complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, based on the confidential information he received, Blystone concluded that the terms of a contemplated securities offering by Tri-Valley would be onerous.  He foresaw that either the company&#8217;s securities would be sold at a discount to the market price or additional securities would be issued if the price of the stock fell, which would dilute the value of Tri-Valley&#8217;s stock.  After leaving the company, Blystone&#8217;s concerns about Tri-Valley&#8217;s securities offering were reinforced when he learned of plans to sell two oil drilling leases in what he characterized in an e-mail to a friend as a &#8220;fire sale.&#8221;  Therefore, Blystone liquidated 50,100 shares of Tri-Valley stock that he held in a brokerage account.  He sold 90 percent of those shares on April 5, the day before Tri-Valley&#8217;s public announcement.  The complaint charges Blystone with violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  Blystone agreed to pay disgorgement of $36,267, prejudgment interest of $2,493, and a penalty of $36,267.  He also agreed to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 and barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  The settlement is subject to court approval.    SEC Complaint    &nbsp;    &nbsp;  http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22367.htm     Home | Previous Page Modified: 05/11/2012",
"  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Apartments America, LLC, Michael J. Stewart, John J. Packard, Randall A. Smith, Civil Action No. SACV 12-754 DOC (ANx) (C.D. Cal.)  SEC CHARGES APARTMENTS AMERICA AND ITS OWNERS IN SCHEME TO DEFRAUD INVESTORS  On May 10 , the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a California-based real estate company and its owners with defrauding potential investors by boasting a false company track record to tout their purported real estate expertise while concealing the bankruptcy of their previous company.  The SEC alleges that Michael J. Stewart, John J. Packard, and Randall A. Smith created Apartments America, LLC to pool investor proceeds from an unregistered offering of securities and invest primarily in apartment buildings in Southern California and Arizona.  They solicited potential investors through a website, Internet advertisements and postings, cold calls, solicitation letters, and advertising in a national newspaper.  They boasted a track record of producing more than a 60 percent annual return on investment and creating more than $100 million in net equity.    According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint filed in federal court in Orange County, California, what potential investors did not know is that Apartments America was a new company with no assets and no track record.  Stewart, Packard, and Smith were merely using the same investment strategy and selective statistics from their prior bankrupt company that had defaulted on $91.6 million in promissory notes held by 647 investors.  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, Stewart lives in San Clemente, California, and Packard and Smith each live in Long Beach, California.  Together they formed Apartments America in September 2009, just three months after Pacific Property Assets (PPA) filed for bankruptcy.  Stewart and Packard owned PPA and Smith worked for them.  In the months prior to defaulting on its promissory notes, PPA was actively soliciting investor funds and promising an annual interest rate of 24 to 30 percent.    The SEC alleges that under Apartments America, whose securities have never been registered with the SEC, Stewart, Packard, and Smith similarly solicited investor funds with the same plan to purchase apartment buildings.  But they engaged in a concerted scheme to distance themselves from PPA and its bankruptcy.  In communications to potential investors, they selectively and misleadingly used some of PPA&#8217;s historic investments and touted them as Apartments America data.  For instance, they arrived at their fabricated statistic of a 60 percent annual return on investment by cherry-picking PPA&#8217;s successful property investments while omitting the losses incurred on more than 50 properties in PPA&#8217;s portfolio at the time of its bankruptcy.  Stewart, Packard, and Smith also misrepresented that they had created more than $100 million in net equity by calculating some of PPA&#8217;s property investments while omitting information about its bankruptcy and the losses on its bankrupt properties.  They also falsely represented to potential investors that they were managing a property portfolio valued at more than $200 million when that in fact referred to PPA&#8217;s bankrupt property portfolio, which was actually being managed by the bankruptcy trustee.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Orange County, California, charges all defendants with violations of Sections 5(c), 17(a)(1), and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The Commission also seeks permanent injunctions against all defendants, and conduct-based injunctions against Stewart, Packard, and Smith, prohibiting them or any entity they own or control from offering unregistered securities.  In addition, the Commission seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and civil penalties against all defendants.

"  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Dr. Bobby V. Khan, Civil Case No. 1:10-cv-2865-JOF (N.D. Ga.)  GEORGIA DOCTOR CONSENTS TO ORDER IN SETTLEMENT OF SEC INSIDER TRADING CHARGES  On May 10 , the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia entered a consent order requiring, among other things, that Defendant Dr. Bobby V. Khan, a Georgia-based doctor, pay more than double the amount of his trading profits obtained through alleged insider trading.  The Commission filed charges against Dr. Bobby V. Khan in September 2010, alleging that he traded illegally in the stock of Georgia-based pharmaceutical company Sciele Pharma, Inc. on the basis of nonpublic information he received just days before the public announcement of a tender offer by a Japanese company to purchase all of that companyâs shares. Khan obtained confidential details about the acquisition from a longtime business associate and friend who was a senior officer at Sciele. Khan subsequently opened an online brokerage account for the first time in several years, transferred approximately one-third of his liquid net worth into it, and purchased 4,000 shares of Sciele stock just days before the tender offerâs public announcement. Khan sold all of his shares after the announcement for an illicit profit of $47,171.  Without admitting or denying the Commissionâs allegations, Dr. Khan agreed, as set forth in the Courtâs order, to pay a total of $100,857.79, consisting of disgorgement, prejudgment interest thereon, and a civil penalty. Dr. Khan also consented to permanent injunctions against violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.

"  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Gerald D. Kegley, et al., Case No. 1:12-CV-1605 (N.D. Ga)  SEC Charges Arizona Resident with Securities Fraud  The Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;Commission&#8221;) filed a civil injunctive action in Atlanta, Georgia on May 8, 2102, alleging that Gerald D. Kegley (&#8220;Kegley&#8221;) and the company he operates, Prism Financial Services, LLC (&#8220;Prism&#8221;), participated in a fraudulent &#8220;Prime Bank&#8221; scheme that violated the antifraud and securities and broker dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws.    The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges that from at least April 8, 2010 through at least August 20, 2010, the defendants were directly responsible for introducing six individuals, who invested $1.95 million, to the fraudulent scheme.  The complaint alleges that in furtherance of the scheme, the defendants forwarded misrepresentations made by others to investors.  These misrepresentations included:  1) that investors could draw upon bank issued guarantees worth millions of dollars without having to repay the withdrawn funds; and 2) that investor funds would be held in escrow until the bank guarantees were issued.  The complaint alleges that defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that both of these representations were false because no such bank guarantees existed and investor funds were misappropriated immediately upon receipt.  Defendants also misrepresented that they would be paid commissions only once the investor received the bank guarantee.  In fact, defendants were paid commissions relatively soon after the investors transferred the money.  Defendants further told investors that they had previously worked on a successful bank guarantee program.  Defendants, however, had actually reported this purportedly successful bank guarantee program to the Federal Bureau of Investigation because they believed it was a fraud.   In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that the defendants violated Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.

Cannon, Case No. 2:12-cv-00408-BCW (USDC Utah, filed April 30 )  SEC FILES INJUNCTIVE ACTION AGAINST INVESTMENT ADVISERS RKC CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC, RKC CAPITAL LLC, AND RUSSELL K. CANNON  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the filing of a Complaint in federal district court against RKC Capital Management LLC, RKC Capital, LLC (&#8220;RKC&#8221;) and Russell K. Cannon (&#8220;Cannon&#8221;), (collectively &#8220;Defendants&#8221;).  The Complaint alleges that the Defendants artificially inflated the assets of a hedge fund they managed, RKC Matador Fund LLC (&#8220;Matador&#8221;), to defraud Matador investors.  The Complaint alleges that from at least November 2007 through July 2011, Defendants engaged in fraudulent conduct to overstate the assets under management of Matador.  Defendants did this through causing the price of Matador&#8217;s largest holding, stock in Global Pari Mutuel Services, Inc. (&#8220;Global&#8221;), to artificially increase by &#8220;marking the close&#8221; of Global&#8217;s stock.  Marking the close is a manipulative trading practice designed to cause the price of a stock to rise at the close of the market.  The Defendants also falsely inflated the fund&#8217;s assets by instructing Matador&#8217;s fund administrator to record the price of Matador&#8217;s holdings in Global above the actual market price for approximately 15 months.  Cannon also misused RKC&#8217;s client accounts to aid his practice of marking the close and to enhance Matador&#8217;s profits.   According to the Commission&#8217;s Complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, the Defendants falsely represented to investors that Matador&#8217;s assets under management and performance returns were greater than they actually were.  In fact, at its peak, Matador&#8217;s assets under management were overstated by over 100% and its performance returns were significantly overstated for several months.  In addition, investor statements the Defendants provided to Matador investors, which reflected the holdings and performance of persons who invested in Matador, were also significantly overstated.  The Defendants made these misrepresentations to investors to convince investors to invest in Matador and to obtain excessive advisory fees.  The Commission&#8217;s Complaint seeks to enjoin the Defendants from future violations of Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and seeks the payment of disgorgement and civil penalties.

"  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Michael J. McNerney, Civil Action No. 1:12-cv-21627   SEC FILES CHARGES AGAINST FORMER ATTORNEY FOR MUTUAL BENEFITS  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a complaint against Defendant Michael J. McNerney, charging him with violations of the federal securities laws arising from his involvement in Mutual Benefits Corp.&rsquo;s (&ldquo;MBC&rdquo;) offering fraud which raised more than $1 billion from approximately 29,000 investors. From 1995 through at least May 2004, McNerney served as primary securities regulatory counsel for MBC. The complaint alleges thatin this role, he helped conceal the fraud, met with investors, and supervised the filing of false reports with state regulators. The Commission&rsquo;s complaint charges McNerney with aiding and abetting MBC&rsquo;s violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief against McNerney, who has consented to the entry of Final Judgment providing for full injunctive relief.    In addition to the civil action against McNerney, the Commission simultaneously issued an Order pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission&rsquo;s Rules of Practice forthwith suspending McNerney from appearing or practicing before the Commission based on the entries of a felony conviction against him. On August 26, 2011, the Honorable Adalberto Jordan, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, sentenced McNerney to 5 years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered him to pay restitution, along with his co-conspirators, in the amount of $826,839,642.   On May 3, 2004, the Commission first halted the on-going fraud at MBC when it filed a contested emergency civil enforcement action against MBC and its principals. In its complaint, the Commission alleged that the defendants raised over $1 billion from thousands of investors through a fraudulent, unregistered offering of securities in the form of fractionalized interests in viatical and life settlements. The Commission obtained a restraining order to halt the alleged fraud at MBC, and thereafter the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida appointed a receiver to identify and trace the assets of MBC.    The Commission&rsquo;s actions regarding MBC have resulted in nine injunctions and other relief against nine defendants and eight relief defendants, and orders to pay disgorgement and civil penalties totaling $30 million.

"  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Usee, Inc., et al, Case No. 3:12-cv-01325-M (N.D.Tex.) (filed April 30 )  SEC CHARGES VOIP COMPANY AND ITS OWNERS WITH CONDUCTING A FRAUDULENT OFFERING TARGETING CHRISTIAN INVESTORS  On April 30 , the Securities and Exchange Commission filed settled fraud charges against the owners of a Dallas-area Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) company, for running a fraudulent securities offering aimed at Christian investors, many of whom were affiliated with a Dallas-based private school. The Commission&rsquo;s complaint, filed in Dallas federal court, alleges that Terry E. Wiese and Scott A. Wiese promised extreme returns &ndash; as much as 1,000% in a year &ndash; to entice investment in their company, Usee, Inc. Contrary to the Wieses&rsquo; claims, however, Usee had no business from which to generate any returns to investors. Instead, the Commission alleges that the Wieses wasted investor funds on poorly considered ventures or sent them to third parties about which they had little information. The Commission also alleges that the Wieses used investor funds for personal expenses and to make Ponzi payments to investors.   According to the complaint, the Wieses and Usee offered two forms of investment: stock and promissory notes. The Wieses promised returns to stock investors of up to 1,000% in the first year. Note investors were promised returns of up to 100% in 60 days. The Wieses also claimed that Usee would earn $26 billion in revenue by its fifth year of business, due to lucrative financing agreements it had arranged. According to the Commission, however, these claims were unfounded, since Usee had only nominal revenue and no financing arrangements.   The Commission alleges that the Wieses told investors that Usee was on the cusp of acquiring another VoIP company that owned valuable technology. In fact, Usee had contracted to acquire this company for $33 million, and sent the company $3 million of investor funds as a down payment. But, according the Commission, Usee and the Wieses never got close to securing funds to complete the acquisition and ultimately forfeited the funds to the other company, a fact never disclosed to investors.   Later, the Commission alleges, the Wieses released more than $1.5 million of investor funds to a company they knew nothing about, NFY Financial Consulting, PLLC. According to the SEC, NFY&rsquo;s principals &ndash; Nail Yaldo and Jack Skrelja &ndash; told the Wieses the funds would be used as &ldquo;proof of funds&rdquo; to support unspecified &ldquo;platform trading.&rdquo; The Commission further alleges that, although they did little due diligence into NFY or its principals, the Wieses assured investors that the funds would be safeguarded in an escrow account and not released for any purpose. The Wieses, however, soon turned investor funds over to NFY without investors&rsquo; consent or knowledge.   The Commission has charged the Wieses and Usee with violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Commission&rsquo;s complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, civil penalties and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment interest. The Commission also seeks to bar the Wieses from serving as officers or directors of any public company.   To settle the Commission&rsquo;s charges, the Wieses and Usee consented to permanent injunctions under Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Defendants further agreed to disgorge nearly $5.8 million in ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment interest, and the Wieses agreed to pay civil penalties totaling $300,000. Defendants are also permanently enjoined from offering or selling securities issued by any company they own or control and the Wieses are further barred from serving as officers or directors of any public company. The defendants did not admit or deny the SEC&rsquo;s allegations.   The SEC&rsquo;s action also names NFY, Yaldo and Skrelja as relief defendants for purposes of recovering the funds released to NFY. The SEC has sought an asset freeze against these parties.

"  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Matthew H. Kluger and Garrett D. Bauer, Case No. 11-cv-1936 (D.N.J. April 6, 2011) (KSH-PS); Securities and Exchange Commission v. Kenneth T. Robinson, Case No. 12-cv-2438 (D.N.J. April 25, 2011) (KSH-PS)  ATTORNEY, WALL STREET TRADER, AND MIDDLEMAN SETTLE SEC CHARGES IN $32 MILLION INSIDER TRADING CASE  Washington, D.C., April 25  â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a settlement in a $32 million insider trading case filed by the agency last year against a corporate attorney and a Wall Street trader.  The SEC alleged that the insider trading occurred in advance of at least 11 merger and acquisition announcements involving clients of the law firm where the attorney â Matthew H. Kluger â worked. He and the trader â Garrett D. Bauer â were linked through a mutual friend now identified as Kenneth T. Robinson, who acted as a middleman to facilitate the illegal tips and trades. Kluger and Bauer used public telephones and prepaid disposable mobile phones to communicate with Robinson in an effort to avoid detection. Robinson, now also charged, cooperated in the SECâs investigation.  Bauer, Kluger, and Robinson each agreed to give up their ill-gotten gains plus interest in order to settle the SECâs charges. Those amounts under the terms of their consent agreements are approximately $31.6 million for Bauer, $516,000 for Kluger, and $845,000 for Robinson.  In parallel criminal actions brought by the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the District of New Jersey, Bauer, Kluger, and Robinson have all pled guilty and are scheduled to be sentenced on June 4 .  Acknowledging the facts to which they have admitted as part of their guilty pleas, Bauer, Robinson, and Kluger consented to final judgments in the SECâs civil actions that are subject to court approval. In the proposed final judgments, Bauer would be ordered to disgorge $30,812,796 plus prejudgment interest of $859,135; Kluger would be ordered to disgorge $502,500 plus prejudgment interest of $14,010; and Robinson would be ordered to disgorge $829,129 plus prejudgment interest of $16,106. They also would be permanently enjoined from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder. Each of the orders of disgorgement will be deemed partially satisfied and offset on a dollar-for-dollar basis by assets seized at the direction of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the District of New Jersey based upon orders of forfeiture.  Bauer also has agreed to settle a related SEC administrative proceeding by consenting to the entry of an order that would bar him from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock. Kluger agreed to settle a related administrative proceeding by consenting to the entry of an order which would permanently suspend him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney pursuant to Commission Rule of Practice 102(e).  The terms of the proposed settlement with Robinson reflect credit given to him by the SEC for his substantial assistance and cooperation in the investigation.  The SECâs investigation was conducted by Colleen K. Lynch, David W. Snyder and John S. Rymas, members of the Market Abuse Unit in the Philadelphia Regional Office, under the supervision of Daniel M. Hawke, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit and Regional Director, and Elaine C. Greenberg, Associate Regional Director for Enforcement in the Philadelphia Regional Office. G. Jeffrey Boujoukos and Scott A. Thompson have been handling the litigation.

Michael Anthony Gonzalez, United States District Court for the Central District of California, Case No. 12-03319 SJO (PLAx) (filed April 17 )  SEC CHARGES LOS ANGELES-BASED PERPETRATOR FOR MUNICIPAL BOND FRAUD SCHEME   The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of a Los Angeles man orchestrating a securities fraud by falsely presenting himself to investors as a specialist in municipal bond investments.    The SEC alleges that Michael Anthony Gonzalez raised approximately $1 million since February 2010 by telling investors he would invest their money in specific tax-exempt municipal bonds insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) . In reality, Gonzalez never purchased the bonds and instead deposited investor money into his own bank account for personal use. He later attempted to conceal the scheme by providing investors with phony confirmation statements.   According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Gonzalez falsely told investors that he was associated with New York-based broker-dealer May Capital Group in order to portray himself as a legitimate money manager. Gonzalez had no dealings with May Capital, and through his false representations and fake confirmations he succeeded in giving investors the false impression that their investments were insured and safe. Gonzalez also provided investors with phony trade confirmations that identified securities that were either not purchased or non-existent.    The Honorable S. James Otero, United States District Judge, granted the SEC&rsquo;s request for a temporary restraining order against Gonzalez and issued orders freezing his assets, requiring accountings, prohibiting the destruction of documents, and granting expedited discovery .&nbsp; The court will hold a hearing on the SEC&rsquo;s motion for a preliminary injunction on May 25 .    The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges Gonzalez with violating the antifraud provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act . In addition to the emergency relief, the SEC&rsquo;s complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and financial penalties against Gonzalez.

"  SEC v. Petr Murmylyuk, Civil Action No. 12-cv-2272-CCC (D.N.J.)  SEC Charges Petr Murmylyuk with Fraudulent Brokerage Account Intrusion Scheme  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that today  it filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Petr Murmylyuk (âMurmylyukâ), a Russian citizen residing in Brooklyn, New York.  The Commission alleges that, on November 1, 2011, Murmylyuk engaged in an online account intrusion scheme in which he stole money from an unsuspecting victim by illegally intruding into the victimâs online brokerage account and fraudulently causing that account to engage in unauthorized options trading with another online brokerage account that Murmylyuk controlled, and which was opened under a fictitious name using a stolen social security number.  Essentially, Murmylyuk entered matching orders in those accounts that caused the intruded victim account first to purchase thinly traded options from Murmylyukâs stolen identity account at a high price, and then to immediately sell the same options back to the stolen identity account at a much lower price, resulting in a profit to Murmylyukâs stolen identity account and a loss to the intruded victim account.  In total, Murmylyukâs fraudulent trading on November 1, 2011 generated illegal profits of more than $30,000 for his stolen identity account, and losses of more than $140,000 for the intruded victim account.    The Commissionâs complaint charges Murmylyuk with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a final judgment order permanently enjoining him from violating those provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and pay a civil penalty.  Criminal charges have also been filed against Murmylyuk in a parallel criminal case.  The Commission thanks the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the District of New Jersey and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their assistance in this matter.  The Commissionâs investigation is continuing.   SEC Complaint   &nbsp;  http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22333.htm     Home | Previous Page Modified: 04/17/2012",
"  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Shervin Neman and Neman Financial, Inc. , et al. Case No. No. CV-12-03142 JHN (PLA)] (C.D. Cal. April 11 )  SEC SHUTS DOWN PONZI SCHEME TARGETING PERSIAN-JEWISH COMMUNITY IN LOS ANGELES  The Securities and Exchange Commission today obtained an emergency court order to halt an alleged ongoing $7.54 million Ponzi scheme that targeted members of the Persian-Jewish community in Los Angeles.  The Commission alleges that for the past two years, Shervin Neman raised money from investors by claiming to be a hedge fund manager. Neman told investors that his purported hedge fund, Neman Financial L.P., invested in foreclosed residential properties that would be quickly flipped for profit, in Facebook shares obtained in private transactions, and highly anticipated initial public offerings, including Groupon, Inc., and LinkedIn Corp., and Angieâs List, Inc. Although Neman promised investors exorbitant returns resulting from his investing acumen and access to pre-IPO shares of well-known companies, what they actually received was simply other investorsâ monies, the hallmark of a Ponzi scheme.  The Honorable Jacqueline H. Nguyen for the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California granted the Commissionâs request for a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Neman and the entities he controlled.  According to the Commissionâs complaint, Neman raised funds from at least 11 investors in the fraudulent securities offering. Most of these investors were members of the Los Angeles Persian-Jewish community, of which Neman is also a member.  The Commission alleges that more than 99% of the money Neman raised was used either to pay returns to existing investors, or to fund his lavish lifestyle. According to the Commission, Neman spent nearly $1.6 million of investor funds to buy jewelry, pay for his wedding and honeymoon, as well as high-end cars, VIP tickets to sporting events, and vacations.  The Commissionâs complaint alleges that Neman and Neman Financial, Inc. violated Section 17(a)(1-3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(a-c) thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(4)-8(a)(1) thereunder, and Neman Financial violated, and Neman aided and abetted violations of, Section 203A and 204(a) of the Advisers Act, and Rule 204-2 thereunder; and seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon, and financial penalties, against each of them. The Commissionâs complaint also names Cassandra C. Neman, Nemanâs wife, as a relief defendant, seeking disgorgement of her ill-gotten gains.  Judge Nguyen has scheduled a court hearing for April 23 at 2 p.m. on the Commissionâs motion for a preliminary injunction.

Taylor, II with Operating a Ponzi Scheme  On April 12 , the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Ephren Taylor II with running a Ponzi scheme that targeted investors in church congregations. The SEC also charged City Capital Corporation and its former chief operating officer Wendy Connor for their roles in the scheme.  According to the SEC, Taylor and City Capital raised approximately $11 million through two fraudulent offerings: (1) promissory notes supposedly funding various small businesses, and (2) interests in âsweepstakes machines.â In addition to promising high rates of return, the SEC alleges that Taylor assured investors he had a long track record of success, that investor funds would be used to support businesses in economically disadvantaged areas and a portion of profits would go to charity.  In reality, according to the SECâs complaint, investor money was used to pay other investors, finance Taylorâs personal expenses, or fund City Capitalâs payroll, rent, and other costs. City Capitalâs business ventures were consistently unprofitable, and no meaningful amounts of investor money were ever sent to charities.  The SECâs complaint alleges that City Capital, Taylor and Connor violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

AutoChina International Limited, Hui Kai Yan, Rui Ge Dong, Victory First Limited, Rainbow Yield Limited, Yong Qi Li, Ai Xi Ji, Ye Wang, Zhong Wen Zhang, Li Xin Ma, Yong Li Li, and Shu Ling Li 1:12-CV-10643-GAO (District of Massachusetts, Complaint filed April 11 )  SEC CHARGES CHINA-BASED COMPANY AND OTHERS WITH STOCK MANIPULATION  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged that AutoChina International Limited and eleven investors, including a senior executive and director at the China-based firm, conducted a market manipulation scheme to create the false appearance of a liquid and active market for AutoChinaâs stock.  According to the SECâs complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, AutoChina senior executive and director Hui Kai Yan, a former AutoChina manager, and others fraudulently traded AutoChinaâs stock to boost its daily trading volume. Starting in October 2010, the defendants and others deposited more than $60 million into U.S.-based brokerage accounts and engaged in hundreds of fraudulent trades over the next three months through these accounts and accounts with a Hong Kong-based broker-dealer. The fraudulent trades included matched orders, where one account sold shares to another account at the same time and for the same price, and wash trades, which resulted in no change of beneficial ownership of the shares. According to the complaint, AutoChina and the other defendants engaged in the scheme after lenders offered AutoChina unfavorable terms for a stock-backed loan due to low trading volume in its stock.  âAutoChina and the other defendants engaged in a brazen manipulation of AutoChinaâs stock to obtain favorable loan terms,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âThe SEC will hold accountable publicly-traded companies, including foreign companies, that violate the U.S. securities laws and disrupt the U.S. capital markets.â  David P. Bergers, Director of the SECâs Boston Regional Office, added, âThe investing public has a right to honest and fair markets. Manipulation of stocks has no place in the financial strategies of any public company.â  The SEC complaint alleges that in the three months before the defendants opened the U.S.-based brokerage accounts, the average daily trading volume of AutoChinaâs stock was approximately 18,000 shares. From November 1, 2010 through January 31, 2011, the average daily trading volume increased to more than 139,000 shares. On some days, the defendants and related accountsâ trading accounted for as much as 70% of the trading of AutoChinaâs stock.  According to the SECâs complaint, several of the defendants are related to AutoChinaâs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who at the time of the scheme owned more than 57% of the company. Three of the defendants are siblings of AutoChinaâs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and another is married to one his siblings.  The SECâs complaint charges AutoChina; Hui Kai Yan; Rui Ge Dong; Victory First Limited; Rainbow Yield Limited; Yong Qi Li; Ai Xi Ji; Ye Wang; Zhong Wen Zhang; Li Xin Ma; Yong Li Li; and Shu Ling Li with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The complaint further alleges that Rui Ge Dong; Victory First Limited; Rainbow Yield Limited; Yong Qi Li; Ai Xi Ji; Ye Wang; Zhong Wen Zhang; Li Xin Ma; Yong Li Li; and Shu Ling Li aided and abetted AutoChinaâs violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from committing future violations of these provisions, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, imposing financial penalties and barring Hui Kai Yan them from acting as an officer or director of a public company.

"  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Van et al. (Civil Action No. CV 12 1743) (N.D. Cal.) (April 9 )  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Silicon Valley businessman raised millions for two Internet start-ups by falsely promising investors that his companies were on the verge of undergoing successful initial public offerings and were well on their way to becoming the &#8220;next Google.&#8221;    The SEC alleges that Benedict Van, of San Jose, Calif., lured investors into web-based start-ups hereUare, Inc. and eCity, Inc. by falsely telling them that the companies would go public within a matter of months and generate millions in quick returns.  In truth, Van had no plans to take the companies public and relied solely on investor funds to stay in business.  Ultimately, when investor funds ran out by the end of 2008, Van was forced to shut down operations.   According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, filed in federal court in the Northern District of California, Van raised more than $6.2 million from investors for hereUare in 2007 and 2008, and raised $880,000 in investor funds for eCity in 2008.  In presentations to prospective investors, chiefly in homes in Sacramento and Stockton, Van held himself out as a wealthy venture capitalist with prior IPO experience.  Van told prospective investors that the companies had lucrative deals and patents, and that he had retained Goldman Sachs and an international law firm to help take the companies public within six months.  According to the SEC, everything Van told prospective investors was false.  The complaint alleges that, by their conduct, Van, hereUare, and eCity violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (&#8220;Securities Act&#8221;) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder; Van and hereUare also violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The defendants&#8217; signed consents &#8212; which are subject to approval by the court &#8212; provide that each defendant is permanently enjoined against future violations of the statutes and rules each is alleged to have violated.  In addition, defendant Van&#8217;s signed consent provides that, without admitting or denying the Commission&#8217;s allegations, he is permanently barred from serving as the officer or director of a public company.  The Commission waived disgorgement and declined to assess a penalty against Van based on his demonstrated inability to pay.  In addition, the Commission separately instituted and simultaneously settled administrative proceedings against hereUare.  hereUare consented to the issuance of the Commission&#8217;s order and the sanction it imposed, without admitting or denying the order&#8217;s findings.  The order found that hereUare improperly failed to file periodic or quarterly reports with the Commission since April 2010, thereby violating Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  Based on these findings, the order revoked the registration of hereUare&#8217;s stock with the Commission.

"  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Quorne Limited and Michael Sarkesian, 10-cv-9560 (GBD) (S.D.N.Y)  BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS CORPORATION AND RESIDENT OF SWITZERLAND SETTLE CHARGES OF INSIDER TRADING IN THE OPTIONS OF INTERMUNE, INC.  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that, on March 29 , the Honorable George B. Daniels,U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of New York, entered a settled final judgment for insider trading in the options of InterMune, Inc. as to Michael S. Sarkesian, a Swiss citizen and resident, and Quorne Ltd., a British Virgin Islands limited liability company wholly owned by a Cyprus trust maintained for the benefit of a Sarkesian relation. The alleged illicit trading by Sarkesian and Quorne took place ahead of a December 17, 2010 announcement that the European Union&rsquo;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, had recommended to the European Commission that it permit InterMune to market its developmental drug, Esbriet, in the European Union. Sarkesian and Quorne consented to the entry of the final judgment, which imposes injunctive and monetary relief. The Commission also announced that on March 27 , it amended its complaint, filed on December 23, 2010 against one or more unknown purchasers of the options of InterMune, to name Sarkesian and Quorne as defendants.  In its amended complaint, the Commission alleges that Sarkesian was tipped to material non-public information concerning the CHMP&rsquo;s recommendation in advance of the December 17 announcement and that, while in possession of this material non-public information, Sarkesian exercised his authority to manage and administer Quorne&rsquo;s funds by recommending to Quorne that it purchase InterMune call options. As a result, Sarkesian caused Quorne to purchase 400 InterMune call options through a brokerage account in Switzerland on December 7 and 8, 2010. The market price of the 400 options rose over 500% following the December 17 announcement.  On December 23, 2010, on the same day that the Commission filed its initial complaint, the Court entered a Temporary Restraining Order freezing assets and trading proceeds from the alleged illicit trading and prohibiting the then-unknown purchasers from disposing of the options or any proceeds from the sale of the options. Quorne later sold the 400 options, the proceeds of which have remained frozen by Court order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the amended complaint, Quorne and Sarkesian consented to entry of a final judgment enjoining them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and ordering them jointly and severally to pay $616,000 in disgorgement and $93,806.17 in civil penalties pursuant to Exchange Act Section 21A. The monetary sanctions will be paid out of the frozen funds. See Litigation Release No. 21794 (December 23, 2010).  The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission, and the British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission.

"  Securities and Exchange Commission v. John M. Cinderey, Civil Case No. CV-12-1519 (N.D. Cal.)  SEC FILES SETTLED CHARGES AGAINST FORMER BANK EXECUTIVE WHO MISLED AUDITORS   The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former bank employee with misleading the bank&rsquo;s independent auditors regarding risks the bank faced on certain outstanding loans. The SEC alleges that John Cinderey, a former executive vice president at San Francisco-based United Commercial Bank, acting at the direction of his superiors, misled the outside auditors evaluating financial statements of the bank and its public holding company, UCBH Holdings, Inc.  In a complaint filed in federal court in San Francisco, the SEC alleges that during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, Cinderey altered memoranda prepared for the independent auditors. The complaint also alleges that Cinderey circumvented accounting controls and policies that required the bank to accurately assess the risks associated with loans, and alleges that delays in accurately evaluating the risks in some cases could affect the bank&rsquo;s loan loss reserves and interest income.   Cinderey agreed to settle the SEC charges without admitting or denying the allegations. He will be permanently enjoined from violating provisions of the federal securities laws regarding record-keeping, misleading outside auditors, and internal controls. Cinderey will not pay a civil penalty in this case in part based on a $40,000 civil penalty he paid in an administrative action brought by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The terms of the settlement also reflect credit given to Cinderey by the Commission for his substantial assistance in the investigation and the fact that he has entered into an cooperation agreement to assist in an ongoing related enforcement action.  The Commission has previously charged senior executives at the bank and UCBH with committing securities fraud by making false and misleading statements to investors and UCBH&rsquo;s independent auditors. In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco on October 11, 2011, Case No. 11-CV-04998, the Commission alleges that former CEO Thomas Wu, former Chief Operating Officer Ebrahim Shabudin, and former executive vice president Thomas Yu deliberately delayed the proper recording of loan losses as the company prepared its 2008 financial statements. SEC Litigation Release No. 22121.  The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges Cinderey with aiding and abetting UCBH&rsquo;s violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), circumventing accounting controls in violation of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and falsifying books and records and making false or misleading statements to auditors in violation of Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2.

"  Securities and Exchange Commission v. David L. Marion and International Rarities Holdings, Inc., Civil Action No. 12-cv-00749 (D. Minn., filed March 26 )   SEC Charges Operator of Gold Coin Firm with Conducting Fraudulent Securities Offering  The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against David L. Marion of Minneapolis, Minnesota and his company, International Rarities Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;IR Holdings&#8221;), accusing them of conducting a fraudulent, unregistered offer and sale of approximately $1 million in securities.    The SEC&#8217;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis, alleges that from at least November 2008 through July 2009, Marion and IR Holdings raised approximately $1 million from at least 26 investors through the offer and sale of IR Holdings securities.  According to the complaint, Marion represented to investors that they were purchasing shares of IR Holdings, which he said was the parent company and 100% owner of International Rarities Corporation (&#8220;IR Corp.&#8221;).  The complaint alleges that IR Corp. is a privately held Minneapolis based gold coin and bullion sales and trading firm that Marion also owned and operated.  The complaint further alleges that Marion told investors that their investments were to be used to expand IR Holdings&#8217; business and eventually take it public.  According to the complaint, Marion&#8217;s representations were false because IR Holdings never owned IR Corp. and thus Marion sold investors shares of a worthless shell company.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Marion did not use the investors&#8217; funds to expand IR Holdings&#8217; business and instead diverted the majority of the funds for his own personal use, including for casino gambling.   The SEC&#8217;s complaint charges Marion and IR Holdings with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, jointly and severally, against Marion and IR Holdings and a civil penalty against Marion.

"  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 3374 / March 26   Securities and Exchange Commission v. Biomet, Inc., Civil Action No. 1: 12-CV-00454 (D.D.C.)(RMC) (March 26 )  SEC CHARGES MEDICAL DEVICE COMPANY BIOMET WITH FOREIGN BRIBERY  Washington, D.C., March 26  &#8212; The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Warsaw, Ind.-based medical device company Biomet Inc. with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when its subsidiaries and agents bribed public doctors in Argentina, Brazil, and China for nearly a decade to win business.    Biomet, which primarily sells products used by orthopedic surgeons, agreed to pay more than $22 million to settle the SEC&#8217;s charges as well as parallel criminal charges announced by the U.S. Department of Justice today.  The charges arise from the SEC and DOJ&#8217;s ongoing proactive global investigation into medical device companies bribing publicly-employed physicians.  The SEC alleges that Biomet and its four subsidiaries paid bribes from 2000 to August 2008, and employees and managers of all levels of the parent company and the subsidiaries were involved along with the distributors who sold Biomet&#8217;s products.  Biomet&#8217;s compliance and internal audit functions failed to stop the payments to doctors even after learning about the illegal practices.  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint filed in federal court in Washington D.C., employees of Biomet Argentina SA paid kickbacks as high as 15 to 20 percent of each sale to publicly-employed doctors in Argentina.  Phony invoices were used to justify the payments, and the bribes were falsely recorded as &#8220;consulting fees&#8221; or &#8220;commissions&#8221; in Biomet&#8217;s books and records.  Executives and internal auditors at Biomet&#8217;s Indiana headquarters were aware of the payments as early as 2000, but failed to stop it.  The SEC alleges that Biomet&#8217;s U.S. subsidiary Biomet International used a distributor to bribe publicly-employed doctors in Brazil by paying them as much as 10 to 20 percent of the value of their medical device purchases. Payments were openly discussed in communications between the distributor, Biomet International employees, and Biomet&#8217;s executives and internal auditors in the U.S.  For example, a February 2002 internal Biomet memorandum about a limited audit of the distributor&#8217;s books stated:  &#8220;Brazilian Distributor makes payments to surgeons that may be considered as a kickback. These payments are made in cash that allows the surgeon to receive income tax free. &#8230;The accounting entry is to increase a prepaid expense account. In the consolidated financials sent to Biomet, these payments were reclassified to expense in the income statement.&#8221;   According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, two additional subsidiaries &#8212; Biomet China and Scandimed AB &#8212; sold medical devices through a distributor in China who provided publicly-employed doctors with money and travel in exchange for their purchases of Biomet products.  Beginning as early as 2001, the distributor exchanged e-mails with Biomet employees that explicitly described the bribes he was arranging on the company&#8217;s behalf.  For example, one e-mail stated:  &#8220;[Doctor] is the department head of [public hospital]. [Doctor] uses about 10 hips and knees a month and it&#8217;s on an uptrend, as he told us over dinner a week ago. &#8230;Many key surgeons in Shanghai are buddies of his. A kind word on Biomet from him goes a long way for us. Dinner has been set for the evening of the 24th. It will be nice. But dinner aside, I&#8217;ve got to send him to Switzerland to visit his daughter.&#8221;  The SEC alleges that some e-mails described the way that vendors would deliver cash to surgeons upon completion of surgery, and others discussed the amount of payments.  The distributor explained in one e-mail that 25 percent in cash would be delivered to a surgeon upon completion of surgery.  Biomet sponsored travel for 20 Chinese surgeons in 2007 to Spain, where a substantial part of the trip was devoted to sightseeing and other entertainment.  Biomet consented to the entry of a court order requiring payment of $4,432,998 in disgorgement and $1,142,733 in prejudgment interest.  Biomet also is ordered to retain an independent compliance consultant for 18 months to review its FCPA compliance program, and is permanently enjoined from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Biomet agreed to pay a $17.28 million fine to settle the criminal charges.  The SEC&#8217;s investigation was conducted by Brent S. Mitchell with Tracy L. Price of the Enforcement Division&#8217;s FCPA Unit and Reid A. Muoio.  The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice&#8217;s Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  The investigation into bribery in the medical device industry is continuing.

SEC CHARGES FIVE WITH INSIDER TRADING ON CONFIDENTIAL MERGER NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN PHILADELPHIA COMPANY AND JAPANESE FIRM  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that, on March 13 , it charged two financial advisors and three others in their circle of family and friends with insider trading for more than $1.8 million in illicit profits based on confidential information about a Philadelphia-based insurance holding companyâs merger negotiations with a Japanese firm.  The SECâs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, charges Timothy J. McGee, of Malvern, Pa., Michael W. Zirinsky, of Schwenksville, Pa., Robert Zirinsky, of Quakertown, Pa. and Hong Kong residents Paulo Lam and Marianna sze wan Ho with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also names as relief defendants Michael Zirinskyâs wife Kellie F. Zirinsky, sister Jillynn Zirinsky, mother Geraldine A. Zirinsky, and grandmother Mary L. Zirinsky for the purpose of recovering illegal profits in their trading accounts. Lam and Ho have each agreed to settle the SECâs charges and pay approximately $1.2 million and $140,000 respectively.  The SECâs complaint alleges that McGee and Michael Zirinsky, who are registered representatives at Ameriprise Financial Services, illegally traded in the stock of Philadelphia Consolidated Holding Corp. (PHLY) based on nonpublic information about the companyâs impending merger with Tokio Marine Holdings. The complaint alleges that McGee misappropriated the inside information from a PHLY senior executive who was confiding in him through their relationship at Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) about pressures he was confronting at work. McGee then purchased PHLY stock in advance of the merger announcement on July 23, 2008, and made a $292,128 profit when the stock price jumped 64 percent that day.  The complaint further alleges that McGee tipped Michael Zirinsky, who purchased PHLY stock in his own trading account as well as those of his wife, sister, mother, and grandmother. Zirinsky tipped his father Robert Zirinsky and his friend Paulo Lam, who in turn tipped another friend whose wife Marianna sze wan Ho also traded on the nonpublic information. The complaint alleges that the Zirinsky family collectively obtained illegal profits of $562,673 through their insider trading. Lam made an illicit profit of $837,975 and Ho profited by $110,580.  The complaint seeks a final judgment ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains together with prejudgment interest from the defendants and relief defendants, and permanent injunctions and penalties against the defendants.  Lam and Ho have each consented, without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. Lam agreed to pay $837,975 in disgorgement, $123,649 in prejudgment interest, and a penalty of $251,392. Ho has agreed to pay $110,580 in disgorgement, $16,317 in prejudgment interest, and a penalty of $16,587. The settlements are subject to court approval.  The SECâs investigation was conducted by Philadelphia Regional Office enforcement staff Brendan P. McGlynn, Patricia A. Paw and Daniel L. Koster. The SECâs litigation will be led by Scott A. Thompson, Nuriye C. Uygur, and G. Jeffrey Boujoukos.

"  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 3370 / March 13   Securities and Exchange Commission v. Larry Goldstone, Clarence Simmons, and Jane Starrett, Case 1:12-cv-00257 (D.N.M.)  SEC Files Civil Injunctive Action Against Senior Management of Thornburg Mortgage, Inc. for Alleged Fraudulent Overstatement of Thornburgâs Income   On March 13 , the Securities and Exchange Commission filed securities fraud charges in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico against Larry Goldstone, the former chief executive officer and president, Clarence Simmons, the former chief financial officer and senior executive vice-president, and Jane Starrett, the former chief accounting officer of Thornburg Mortgage, Inc. (âThornburgâ), currently TMST, Inc., for allegedly materially misrepresenting the financial condition and liquidity of Thornburg, formerly the countryâs second largest independent mortgage company.  Goldstone, Simmons, and Starrett reside in Santa Fe, New Mexico.    The Complaint alleges that Thornburg, through Goldstone, Simmons, and Starrett, fraudulently overstated its quarterly income by more than $420 million in its 2007 annual report filed with the Commission.  As a result, the Complaint alleges that Thornburg fraudulently reported a profit rather than a loss for the quarter.  According to the Complaint, in the two weeks leading to the filing of its annual report, Thornburg received more than $300 million in margin calls from its lenders that severely drained its liquidity.  The Complaint further alleges that, unable to meet its margin calls on a timely basis, Thornburg violated three of its lending agreements, and received a reservation of rights letter from one lender in which the lender reserved its right to declare Thornburg in default at any time.  Accordingly, the Complaint alleges that in the days before Thornburg filed its annual report, the collateral it used for its lending agreements, adjustable rate mortgage (âARMâ) securities, was subject to being seized and sold by its lenders.  According to the Complaint, given the circumstances of Thornburgâs liquidity crisis, circumstances that were misrepresented to, and concealed from, the companyâs auditor, Goldstone, Simmons, and Starrett each knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that Thornburg did not have the intent or ability to hold its ARM  securities until maturity or until their value recovered in the market.  The Complaint concludes that the individual defendants also knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that this meant Thornburg was required to recognize on its income statement approximately $428 million of losses associated with the companyâs ARM securities, and that the proper accounting treatment for these securities would have resulted in Thornburg reporting a loss rather than a profit for the quarter.    The Complaint claims that, based on this conduct, the defendants violated or aided and abetted the violation of, or in the case of Goldstone and Simmons are liable as control persons under Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) for Thornburgâs violation of, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder.  The Complaint also claims that Goldstone and Simmons violated Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act.  As part of this action, the Commission seeks against each of the defendants an injunction against future violations of the provisions set forth above, officer and director bars, and third tier civil money penalties.

"  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Edward V. Ellis, Sr. and Jennifer L. Seidel, Civil Action No. 12-cv-1203 (CDJ) (E.D.Pa.)   SEC Charges Two Operators of Home Maintenance Company with Conducting Fraudulent Securities Offering  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that, on March 7 , it filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against Edward V. Ellis, Sr. and Jennifer L. Seidel of Pottstown, Pennsylvania.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges that Ellis and Seidel orchestrated a fraudulent, unregistered offering of Sederon, Inc. (&#8220;Sederon&#8221;) stock.  Sederon was a Collegeville, Pennsylvania, based company that provided home maintenance services to residential home owners.  Ellis and Seidel have agreed to settle the matter. The settlements are pending final approval by the court.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges that from at least August 2007 through October 2008, Ellis and Seidel raised approximately $519,500 from more than 50 investors by offering and selling Sederon stock through material misrepresentations and omissions.  According to the complaint, Ellis and Seidel made numerous misrepresentations to investors, including that Sederon was a highly profitable and rapidly expanding home maintenance company, and that Sederon would soon be launching an initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;) that would allow investors to be able to sell their shares in the open market at a profit of 900 to 1,300 percent.  In reality, Sederon never pursued an IPO, was never profitable, and often failed to generate enough revenue to meet payroll and other expenses.  The defendants also misled investors about the use of investor proceeds, and failed to disclose the fact that Ellis is a convicted felon and securities fraud recidivist.   Ellis and Seidel have each consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The order will bar Ellis and Seidel from serving as an officer or director of a public reporting company.  Ellis and Seidel will also be ordered, jointly and severally, to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $569,575.    The defendants each pled guilty to criminal charges of mail fraud and wire fraud in connection with the same conduct alleged in the Commission&#8217;s complaint.

"  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Steven J. Harrold, United States District Court, Central District of California, Civil Action No. CV 12-1959 GW(JCx)  SEC CHARGES FORMER EXECUTIVE AT COCA-COLA BOTTLING COMPANY WITH INSIDER TRADING  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former executive at a Coca-Cola bottling company with insider trading based on confidential information he learned on the job about potential upcoming business with The Coca-Cola Company.  The SEC alleges that Steven Harrold, who was a Vice President at Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., purchased company stock in his wife&#8217;s brokerage account after learning that his company had agreed to acquire The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s bottling operations in Norway and Sweden.  The stock price jumped over 30 percent when the deal was announced publicly the following day, enabling Harrold to make an illicit $86,850 profit.  Coca-Cola Enterprises is one of the world&#8217;s largest marketers, producers and distributors of Coca-Cola products, and its stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol CCE.  The Coca-Cola Company (ticker symbol: KO) develops and sells its products and syrup concentrate to Coca-Cola Enterprises and other bottlers.  Coca-Cola Enterprises combines the concentrate with other ingredients to create and package the beverages, and then markets them to consumers.   According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Harrold was regularly in possession of sensitive and confidential information as an executive at CCE.  On numerous occasions, Harrold signed non-disclosure agreements requiring him to keep confidential any information he learned about acquisitions being considered.  Harrold also periodically received blackout notices prohibiting him from trading in company stock for a defined period in which he was likely to be in possession of confidential information.    The SEC alleges that Harrold, who lives in Los Angeles and London, was informed in early January 2010 that CCE was considering the acquisition of The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations.  He signed a non-disclosure agreement requiring him to maintain the confidentiality of any nonpublic information he learned about the potential transaction.  Harrold also received an e-mail from CCE&#8217;s legal counsel informing him that he was subject to a blackout period and was prohibited from trading in CCE stock &#8220;until further notice.&#8221;  Nevertheless, the SEC alleges that Harrold purchased 15,000 CCE shares in his wife&#8217;s brokerage account on Feb. 24, 2010, the day before the announcement of the transaction with The Coca-Cola Company.  The insider trading was based on certain confidential information that Harrold learned in the days leading up to the announcement, including that the transaction was internally valued at more than $800 million and was viewed as creating significant positive growth opportunities for CCE.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint charges Harrold with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  The complaint seeks a final judgment ordering Harrold to pay a financial penalty and disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, preventing him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and permanently enjoining him from future violations of those provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC acknowledges the assistance of FINRA in this matter.

"  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Prime Star Group, Inc., et al., Civil Action No. 2:12-cv-00371 (D. Nev.) (March 7 )  The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada against Prime Star Group, Inc. and its chief executive officer Roger Mohlman of Las Vegas, Nevada, for violations of antifraud, registration, reporting, and books and records provisions, and against Danny Colon and Marysol Morera of Edgewater, New Jersey, Felix Rivera of Clifton, New Jersey, New Jersey limited liability company DC International Consulting LLC, Kevin Carson of Lake Worth, Florida, Esper Gullatt, Jr. of Aurora, Colorado, Minnesota corporation The Stone Financial Group, Inc., and Joshua Konigsberg of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida for registration violations.    According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, Prime Star illegally distributed more than 18 million purportedly unrestricted Rule 144 shares pursuant to backdated consulting agreements or forged attorney opinion letters.  The SEC alleges that in furtherance of a pump and dump scheme, Prime Star and Mohlman issued the shares to consultants Colon, Morera, Rivera, DC International Consulting LLC, Carson, The Stone Financial Group, Inc., and Konigsberg who liquidated Prime Star stock and either kept a portion of the sales proceeds or forwarded proceeds to promoters to tout Prime Star.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint also alleges that Prime Star and Mohlman made false and misleading statements in Prime Star&#8217;s SEC filings and in various press releases during the relevant time period.  The SEC alleges that Prime Star and Mohlman violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Prime Star violated Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission&#8217;s complaint, and subject to court approval, Konigsberg has consented to the entry of a judgment that would enjoin him from future violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.      Separately, the Commission today issued an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings and Notice of Hearing Pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against Prime Star, to determine whether the registration of each class of its securities should be revoked or suspended for a period not exceeding twelve months based on its failure to file required periodic reports.  The Division of Enforcement alleges that Prime Star has failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder by failing to file periodic reports required by these provisions.

Brian Raymond Callahan, of Old Westbury, New York, raised more than $74 million from at least two dozen investors since 2005, promising them their money would be invested in liquid assets, the SEC alleged in a complaint filed in federal court in Islip, New York.&nbsp; Instead, Callahan diverted investors&#8217; money to his brother-in-law&#8217;s beach resort and residences project, which was facing foreclosure, and in return received unsecured, illiquid promissory notes, according to the complaint.&nbsp; Callahan also used investors&#8217; funds to pay other investors and to make a down payment on the $3.35 million unit he purchased at his brother-in-law&#8217;s real estate project, the SEC alleged.   Callahan operated the five funds through his investment advisory firms, Horizon Global Advisors Ltd., and Horizon Global Advisors, LLC, and used the promissory notes to hide his misuse of investor funds, the complaint alleged. The promissory notes overstated the amount of money diverted to the real estate project; for instance, in 2011, Callahan received $14.5 million in promissory notes in exchange for only $3.3 million he provided to his brother-in-law. The inflated promissory notes allowed Callahan to overstate the amount of assets he was managing, and inflate his management fees by 800% or more.   Callahan refused to testify in the SEC&#8217;s investigation and recently informed investors about the investigation, but gave false assurances that no laws had been broken.&nbsp; Callahan also misled investors by not disclosing that in 2009, the Financial Regulatory Industry Authority barred him from associating with any FINRA member, the SEC alleged.   The SEC charges Callahan and his advisory firms with violating federal antifraud laws, specifically Sections 17(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a), (b) and (c) thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.&nbsp; The SEC is seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions against Callahan and his firms, return of ill-gotten gains, with interest, and civil penalties     At the SEC&#8217;s request, and after a court hearing on March 5 , the court granted a temporary restraining order freezing the assets of Callahan and his advisory firms, enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions and granting other emergency relief.&nbsp;    The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission and the Bermuda Monetary Authority.

(&#8220;Puda&#8221;) and the former CEO of Puda with securities fraud for the undisclosed theft of the primary asset of the U.S. public company they controlled.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges as follows:  Defendants Ming Zhao, the Chairman of Puda, and Liping Zhu, Puda&#8217;s former CEO, perpetrated a massive fraud on Puda&#8217;s public shareholders by effectively stealing and selling Puda&#8217;s operating subsidiary.  Before the defendants&#8217; fraud, Puda held an indirect 90% ownership stake in Shanxi Puda Coal Group Co., Ltd (&#8220;Shanxi Coal&#8221;), a coal mining company located in the Shanxi Province of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (&#8220;PRC&#8221;).   In September 2009, just weeks before Puda announced that Shanxi Coal had received a highly lucrative mandate from the provincial government authorities to become a consolidator of smaller coal mining companies, Zhao, with Zhu&#8217;s knowledge and complicity, transferred Puda&#8217;s 90% stake in Shanxi Coal to himself.  In July 2010, Zhao transferred a 49% equity interest in Shanxi Coal to CITIC Trust Co. Ltd. (&#8220;CITIC Trust&#8221;), a Chinese private equity fund controlled by CITIC Group, which is reported to be the largest state-owned investment firm in the PRC.  CITIC Trust placed its 49% stake in Shanxi Coal in a trust and then sold interests in the trust to Chinese investors.  In addition, Zhao caused Shanxi Coal to pledge 51% of its assets to CITIC Trust as collateral for a loan of RMB 3.5 billion ($516 million) from the trust to Shanxi Coal.  In exchange, CITIC Trust gave Zhao 1.212 billion preferred shares in the trust.  None of these asset transfers were approved by Puda&#8217;s board or its shareholders or disclosed in Puda&#8217;s various SEC filings, which Zhao and Zhu signed knowing that those documents were materially false and misleading.  Puda also conducted two public offerings in 2010 in the U.S. without disclosing that it no longer had any ownership stake in the coal company, Puda&#8217;s sole source of revenue.  Thus, at the same time that CITIC Trust was effectively selling interests in the coal company to Chinese investors, Zhao and Zhu were still telling U.S. investors that Puda owned a 90% stake in that company.  In addition, Zhao and Zhu continued their fraudulent scheme to deceive public investors even after the Commission began its investigation.  As part of the fraud, Zhu forged a letter purporting to be from CITIC Trust which falsely stated that no funds had actually been loaned to Shanxi Coal and disclaimed any interest in Puda&#8217;s or Shanxi Coal&#8217;s assets.  Zhao&#8217;s counsel then provided the forged letter to the Commission&#8217;s investigative staff and to Puda&#8217;s audit committee in an effort to create the false impression that Puda and its public shareholders had not been harmed by the asset transfers.  After Puda disclosed the letter to the public in an SEC filing, further misleading shareholders about the ownership of Puda&#8217;s assets, the letter was exposed as a forgery.  Zhu admitted forging the letter and resigned as CEO, but Zhao remains Chairman.  As a result of the defendants&#8217; fraud, Puda is now little more than a shell company, with no ongoing business operations.  Both Zhao and Zhu are charged in the Commission&#8217;s complaint with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, 14a-3, and 14a-9a thereunder.  Both men are also alleged to be liable pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act as control persons of Puda for Puda&#8217;s violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, and that they are also liable pursuant to Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act for aiding and abetting those violations.  Zhu is also charged with violating Exchange Act Rule 13a-14.  Finally, the Commission alleges, in the alternative, that Zhao and Zhu are liable pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act as control persons of Puda for Puda&#8217;s violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a), 10b-5(b), and 10b-5(c), 14a-3 and 14a-9, and that they are also liable pursuant to Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act for aiding and abetting those violations.  The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from committing future violations of these provisions, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, imposing financial penalties and barring them from acting as officers or directors of a public company.

Hamilton, United States District Court for the Southern District of California, Case No. 3:12-cv-00445-DMS-BLM (S.D. Cal.) (February 21 ).  SEC CHARGES INDIVIDUAL AND THREE OF HIS COMPANIES WITH RUNNING ILLEGAL PONZI SCHEMES  The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced it has charged Steven L. Hamilton and Verde Retirement LLC, Verde FX Nevada, LLC, Covenant Capital Partners with securities fraud for defrauding at least 23 investors out of $1.6 million in a series of Ponzi schemes.  The SEC alleges from 2007 through February 2011, Hamilton solicited investors through the internet and via direct solicitation. The SECâs complaint alleges that Hamilton told Covenant Capital investors they were investing in real estate loans secured by deeds of trust, told Verde Retirement investors they were investing in either real estate loans secured by deeds of trust, certificates of deposit, and told Verde FX investors they were pooling their money to invest in the construction of a new FedEx distribution facility in Las Vegas, Nevada.  According to the SECâs complaint, Hamilton never placed any investor money in real estate loans secured by deeds of trust, certificates of deposit or a FedEx facility. Instead, Hamilton used the $1.6 million he raised to pay his personal living expenses and return capital to investors.  The SECâs complaint alleges that Verde Retirement LLC, Verde FX Nevada, LLC, Covenant Capital Partners, and Steven Hamilton violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2), and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

"  SEC v. John Kinnucan and Broadband Research Corporation, Civil Action 12-CV-1230 (SDNY) (AJN) (AJP)  SEC Charges Oregon-Based Expert Consulting Firm and Owner with Insider Trading in Technology Sector  On February 17 , the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging John Kinnucan and his Portland, Oregon-based expert consulting firm Broadband Research Corporation with insider trading.   The charges stem from the SEC&#8217;s ongoing investigation of insider trading involving expert networks. In a parallel criminal case, Kinnucan has been arrested and charged with one count of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud.  The SEC has charged 22 defendants in enforcement actions arising out of its expert networks investigation, which has uncovered widespread insider trading at several hedge funds and other investment advisory firms. The insider trading has occurred in the securities of 12 technology companies &#8212; including Apple, Dell, Fairchild Semiconductor, Marvell Technology, and Western Digital &#8212; for illicit gains totaling nearly $110 million.   The SEC alleges that Kinnucan and Broadband claimed to be in the business of providing clients with legitimate research about publicly-traded technology companies, but instead typically tipped clients with material nonpublic information that Kinnucan obtained from prohibited sources inside the companies. Clients then traded on the inside information. Portfolio managers and analysts at prominent hedge funds and investment advisers paid Kinnucan and Broadband significant consulting fees for the information they provided. Kinnucan in turn compensated his sources with cash, meals, ski trips and other vacations, and even befriended some sources to gain access to confidential information.   According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, Kinnucan&#8217;s misconduct occurred from at least 2009 to 2010, a period during which he generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual revenues for Broadband. Kinnucan obtained material nonpublic information from well-placed employees at a variety of publicly-traded technology companies.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint specifically alleges that in July 2010, Kinnucan obtained material nonpublic information from a source at F5 Networks Inc., a Seattle-based provider of networking technology. On the morning of July 2, Kinnucan learned that F5 had generated better-than-expected financial results for the third quarter of its 2010 fiscal year, with the public announcement scheduled for July 21. Within hours of learning the confidential details, Kinnucan had phone conversations or left messages with several clients to convey that F5&#8217;s revenues would exceed market expectations. At least three clients &#8212; an analyst and two portfolio managers &#8212; caused trades at their respective investment advisory firms on the basis of Kinnucan&#8217;s inside information. The insider trading resulted in profits or avoided losses of nearly $1.6 million.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint, which charges Kinnucan and Broadband with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, seeks a final judgment ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, requiring them to pay financial penalties, and permanently enjoining them from future violations.

"  SEC CHARGES INVESTMENT ADVISER BRENDA A. ESCHBACH WITH MULTI-YEAR MISAPPROPRIATION OF CLIENT FUNDS  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Brenda A. Eschbach, No. SA CV 12 0244 (AG) (JPRx) (C.D. Cal.).  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on February 14 , it filed a civil injunctive action in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California charging Brenda A. Eschbach of Tustin, California with securities fraud, investment advisory fraud, and acting as an unregistered broker-dealer. In its complaint, the Commission alleged that Eschbach misappropriated over $3 million in investment advisory client funds from 2003 through 2009.  The Commissionâs complaint alleges that Eschbach violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933(Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of those provisions, disgorgement of her ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment interest thereon, and a civil money penalty.  The complaint alleges that Eschbach began to misappropriate client funds while operating a franchise of a large investment adviser and broker-dealer and that the theft of client funds continued after Eschbach founded Aventine Investment Services, Inc., a now-defunct California corporation. The complaint further alleges that Eschbach did not make investments as directed by her clients, instead stealing their funds and using them to pay for, among other things, living expenses, business expenses, credit card payments, Mercedes lease payments, private school tuition for her daughter, and trips to Las Vegas and Atlanta. The complaint alleges that Eschbach concealed her misappropriations by issuing and mailing false and misleading account statements to those clients whom she had defrauded.  Without denying the Commissionâs allegations, Eschbach has consented to entry of a proposed final judgment: (1) permanently enjoining her from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act, Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act; and (2) ordering disgorgement of $2,561,873, payment of which would be deemed satisfied dollar for dollar by criminal restitution ordered in a related criminal proceeding, U.S. v. Brenda A. Eschbach, 8:10-cr-00017-JVS (C.D. Cal.). Entry of the proposed final judgment is subject to approval by the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.  In the related federal prosecution, Eschbach entered a plea of guilty on September 30, 2011 to one count of mail fraud and one count of money laundering. She is currently awaiting sentencing.  Eschbach has also consented to the issuance of a Commission Order barring her from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock. Issuance of such an Order is predicated on entry of the proposed injunction against Eschbach and her plea of guilty in the federal prosecution.  The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorneyâs Office for the Central District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Criminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service.

"  SEC v. Brent C. Bankosky, Civil Action No. 12-Civ-1012 (HB)  On February 9 , the Securities and Exchange Commission charged that a former employee of Takeda Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. traded on inside information about the Japanese firm's business alliances and corporate acquisitions.  Brent Bankosky, a former Senior Director in Takeda's U.S.-based business development group, has agreed to pay more than $136,000 to settle the SEC's charges. The proposed settlement is subject to the approval of Judge Harold Baer, Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Under the proposed settlement, the Court, upon motion by the Commission, will determine whether to impose an officer-and-director bar against Bankosky.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Bankosky reaped more than $63,000 of profits, achieving a 169% rate of return, by trading on non-public information about two business transactions in 2008. Takeda's business development group worked on the transactions, a strategic alliance with Cell Genesys, Inc., and the acquisition of Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which were referred to internally by their code names, Project Ceres and Project Mercury. Bankosky's trading violated U.S. securities laws and Takeda's policies, which forbade employees from disclosing or trading based on inside information.  According to the SEC's complaint, almost immediately after Bankosky joined Takeda in January 2008 as a Director in its business development group, he began to misuse confidential corporate information for his personal benefit. In February 2008, Bankosky began placing trades in his personal brokerage account based on non-public information about Takeda's proposed strategic alliance with Cell Genesys, which was announced in March. Starting in March 2008, Bankosky made additional trades for his own account based on non-public information about Takeda's plan to acquire Millennium, which was announced in April. Bankosky also traded on other confidential information in 2009 and 2010, purchasing call options in the securities of Arena Pharmaceutical, Inc., and AMAG Pharmaceutical, Inc., respectively, when the firms were engaged in confidential discussions on business transactions with Takeda. Bankosky, who was promoted to Senior Director of Takeda's business development group in September 2010, resigned from Takeda in May 2011.  The SEC's complaint charges Bankosky with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, as well as Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3. The complaint seeks a final judgment ordering Bankosky to pay a financial penalty and disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, preventing him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and permanently enjoining him from future violations of those provisions of the federal securities laws.   # # #   SEC Complaint in this matter   &nbsp;    &nbsp;  http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22255.htm     Home | Previous Page  Modified: 02/13/2012",

DACHMAN FOR ORCHESTRATING A MISAPPROPRIATION SCHEME AND OFFERING FRAUD  On February 6 , the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Glencoe, Illinois resident Kenneth A. Dachman with misappropriating over $1.8 million in investor funds and making false and misleading statements to investors in offerings for three companies for which he was the Chairman &#8211; Central Sleep Diagnostics, LLC (Central Sleep), Central Sleep Diagnostics of Florida, LLC (Central Sleep Florida), and Advanced Sleep Devices, LLC (Advanced Sleep).  The SEC also charged Scott A. Wolf and his company, Stone Lion Management, Inc., the brokers for the three offerings, for their roles in selling unregistered securities to investors.    Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the SEC&#8217;s complaint alleges that between July 2008 and June 2010, Dachman raised at least $3,594,709 from investors located in 13 states and 12 foreign countries on behalf of Central Sleep, a purported provider of outpatient diagnostic sleep studies.  Between December 2008 and April 2010, Dachman raised an additional $567,399 on behalf of Central Sleep Florida, a purported expansion of Central Sleep into Florida, and Advanced Sleep, a purported provider of medical devices.  According to the complaint, Dachman made numerous misrepresentations to investors in each of the companies, including misrepresentations about how their funds would be used and his academic and business backgrounds.  Dachman also failed to tell investors that he misappropriated at least $1,875,739 of their funds, over 45% of the total funds raised.  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, among other things, Dachman used investor funds to rent-to-own a 10,000 square foot home, to pay for family vacations to Alaska, Europe and elsewhere, to purchase a new Range Rover, books, collectibles and antiques, and for personal expenses and credit card bills.  Dachman also diverted investor funds to a tattoo parlor that he co-owned with his son-in-law.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint further alleges that Wolf and Stone Lion acted as unregistered brokers in selling unregistered securities to investors without qualifying for an exemption from the SEC&#8217;s registration provisions.  The SEC alleges that Dachman violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and that Wolf and Stone Lion violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and penny stock bars.    Wolf and Stone Lion each have agreed to settle the SEC&#8217;s charges without admitting or denying the allegations against them.  Wolf and Stone Lion have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.  Wolf also has agreed to pay disgorgement of $335,216, prejudgment interest of $16,268, and a penalty of $20,000, and to be barred from participating in an offering of penny stock for one year.

Smith &amp; Nephew PLC, Civil Action No. 1: 12-CV-00187 (D.D.C.)(GK) (February, 6 )  SEC CHARGES SMITH &amp; NEPHEW PLC WITH FOREIGN BRIBERY  The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a settlement with Smith &amp; Nephew PLC to resolve SEC charges that the global medical device company violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when its subsidiaries bribed public doctors in Greece for more than a decade.  Smith &amp; Nephew PLC, headquartered in London, England, is a global medical device company with operations around the world.    The SEC alleges that, from 1997 to June 2008, two of Smith &amp;Nephew PLC&#8217;s subsidiaries, including its U.S. subsidiary, Smith &amp; Nephew Inc., used a distributor to create a slush fund to make illicit payments to public doctors employed by government hospitals or agencies in Greece.  Smith &amp;Nephew PLC agreed to settle the SEC&#8217;s charges by paying more than $5.4 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.  Smith &amp;Nephew PLC&#8217;s U.S. subsidiary, Smith &amp; Nephew Inc., agreed to pay a $16.8 million fine to settle parallel criminal charges announced by the U.S. Department of Justice today.    The SEC&#8217;s complaint alleges that, starting in 1997, Smith &amp;Nephew PLC&#8217;s subsidiaries developed a scheme to create an offshore fund to pay Greek public doctors to purchase products from two Smith &amp;Nephew PLC subsidiaries, Smith &amp; Nephew Inc. and Smith &amp; Nephew GmbH.  According to the complaint, Smith &amp;Nephew PLC&#8217;s subsidiaries made payments to a total of three shell entities in the United Kingdom controlled by the distributor that were used to pay bribes.  The complaint alleges that on paper, it appeared as if Smith &amp;Nephew PLC&#8217;s subsidiaries were paying for marketing services, but no services were actually performed.  The complaint also alleges that Smith &amp;Nephew PLC failed to act on numerous red flags of bribery and that employees at Smith &amp;Nephew PLC and its subsidiaries were aware of the payments.    Smith &amp;Nephew PLC has consented, without admitting or denying the SEC&#8217;s allegations, to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; ordering it to pay $4,028,000 in disgorgement and $1,398,799 in prejudgment interest; and ordering it to retain an independent compliance monitor for a period of eighteen months to review its  FCPA compliance program.

"  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 3360 / January 30   SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. ROBERT CHIU (A/K/A CHI HUNG CHIU), Civil Action No. CV-12-00200-PHX-JWS (JWS) (D. Ariz.) (Filed Jan. 30 )  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v.

PRATT, Civil Action No. CV-11-1712-PHX-SRB (SRB) (D. Ariz.) (Filed Aug. 30, 2011)  RELATIONSHIP PARTNER AT ACCOUNTING FIRM CHARGED WITH FRAUD AND BARRED FOR FIVE YEARS; FORMER SYNTAX-BRILLIAN CORP. EXECUTIVE ORDERED TO PAY MORE THAN $48 MILLION FOR INSIDER TRADING AND FINANCIAL FRAUD  On January 30 , the Securities and Exchange Commission filed settled charges against Robert Chiu for aiding and abetting the fraudulent revenue recognition scheme at Syntax-Brillian Corporation (âSyntaxâ), a developer of high-definition LCD televisions. In addition, on January 12 , Judge Susan R. Bolton of the United States District Court for the District of Arizona entered a default judgment against Thomas Chow, formerly the Chief Procurement Officer and a Director of Syntax. The Court permanently enjoined Chow from future violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records, internal controls, and misrepresentation to auditor provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordered him to pay disgorgement of $10,370,317.16, prejudgment interest of $2,567,483.64, an insider trading penalty of $30,849,951.48, and a civil penalty of $4,680,000.00 for his role in the financial fraud scheme. Chow was also permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company.  As alleged in the SECâs Complaint against Chow, from at least June 2006 through April 2008, Chow and other members of Syntaxâs senior management engaged in a complex scheme to overstate Syntaxâs revenues and earnings and artificially inflate its stock price. As a result, Syntax reported false and misleading financial statements beginning in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, through the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 2007. The scheme included the creation of fictitious sales and shipping documents and coordinating the circular transfer of funds among and between Syntax, its primary manufacturer&nbsp;in Taiwan, and its purported distributor in Hong Kong.  In its Complaint against Chiu, the SEC alleged that he served as an audit and relationship partner for Syntaxâs outside auditor. Specifically, the SEC alleged that Chiu instructed Syntax executives on how to create a backdated distribution agreement to assist them in improperly recognizing revenue in Syntaxâs fourth quarter ended June 30, 2006. Additionally, the SEC alleged that after his firm was replaced as Syntaxâs auditor, Chiu participated in an engagement for Syntaxâs purported distributor, where he learned that it was treating the Syntax sales as agency sales. This treatment was in contrast to Syntaxâs treatment of the same sales. Despite his knowledge, Chiu failed to object to his accounting firmâs issuance of multiple consents to the reissuance of its audit opinion to Syntaxâs Form 10-K for fiscal year 2007.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECâs complaint, Chiu consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder. Chiu also consented to the institution of settled administrative proceedings pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commissionâs Rules of Practice suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, with the right to reapply after five years.  The settlement with Chiu takes into account his substantial cooperation with the Commissionâs investigation.  The Commission has previously obtained permanent injunctions against defendants James Li, Roger Kao, Christopher Liu, and Wayne Pratt, and collected total disgorgement of $88,000, prejudgment interest of $17,000, and civil penalties of $290,000. In addition, the Commission obtained officer and director bars against Li, Liu, and Pratt, as well as the entry of an administrative order suspending Pratt from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant with the right to reapply after five years.

SETTLE FINANCIAL FRAUD CASE  SYMMETRYâS FORMER CEO SETTLES RELATED CLAWBACK CLAIM  BRITISH SUBSIDIARYâS OUTSIDE AUDITORS, FORMERLY WITH ERNST &amp; YOUNG UK LLP, ACCEPT SUSPENSIONS FOR DEFICIENT AUDITS  Related Settled Administrative Proceedings Against Symmetry and its CFO Also Announced  The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced four enforcement actions arising from an alleged financial fraud spanning several years at a British subsidiary of the NYSE-listed Symmetry Medical, Inc. (âSymmetryâ).  First, the Commission announced today that it has filed and, subject to Court approval, simultaneously settled charges against Richard J. Senior, Matthew Bell, Lynne Norman and Shaun P. Whiteley arising from the alleged financial fraud. According to the Commissionâs Complaint, the fraud was orchestrated and carried out by senior executives and accounting staff of the Sheffield, England-based Symmetry Medical Sheffield LTD, f/k/a Thornton Precision Components, Limited (hereinafter âTPCâ), particularly by Senior, Bell, Norman and Whiteley, who were, respectively, Symmetryâs VP for European Operations, TPCâs Finance Director, TPCâs Controller and a TPC Management Accountant. According to the Complaint, the fraud involved the systematic understatement of expenses and overstatement of assets and revenues, and materially distorted the financial statements of the Indiana-headquartered Symmetry, into which TPCâs financials were consolidated, for a period running from Symmetryâs December 2004 initial public offering through its second fiscal quarter of 2007. The Complaint further alleges that during the fraud, Senior, Bell and Norman made false certifications as to the accuracy of the financial information reported to Symmetry by TPC, and lied to TPCâs outside auditors. Finally, the Complaint alleges that Senior and Bell sold Symmetry stock during the fraud, at prices each knew or recklessly disregarded were inflated by the fraud at TPC.  According to the Complaint, by their conduct, Senior, Bell, Norman and Whiteley violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and aided and abetted Symmetryâs violation of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; Senior and Bell also violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; and Senior, Bell and Norman also violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2. The four defendantsâ signed Consentsâwhich are subject to approval by the Courtâprovide that, without admitting or denying the Commissionâs allegations, defendants Senior, Bell and Norman would be barred from serving as an officer or director of any public company. (Additionally, Bell, Norman and Whiteley each consented to be permanently barred, in follow-on administrative proceedings, from appearing or practicing before the Commission as accountants.) The final judgment to which Bell consented further orders that he is liable for disgorgement of $136,209 together with $50,728 in prejudgment interest thereon, but, based on his sworn financial statements and supporting documentation, waives payment of disgorgement and prejudgment interest; and the judgment to which Senior consented defers resolution of the monetary portion of his case pending the completion of asset discovery, with which Senior would be ordered to cooperate. Each defendant would also be permanently enjoined against future violations of the statutes and rules each is alleged to have violated.  The Commission also announced that it has filed, and, subject to Court approval, simultaneously settled, a civil action against Symmetryâs former CEO, Brian S. Moore, seeking reimbursement for bonuses and other incentive-based and equity-based compensation pursuant Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Commissionâs Complaint alleges that Symmetry was required to restate its annual financial statements for 2005 and 2006, as well as other reporting periods, as a result of misconduct in the reporting of TPCâs financials. The Complaint further alleges that Moore received from Symmetry bonuses and incentive-based and equity-based compensation, and realized profits from the sale of Symmetry stock, during the 12-month periods following the restated financials, but has made no reimbursement thereof. The Complaint does not allege that Moore engaged in the fraud. Mooreâs signed Consentâwhich is subject to approval by the Courtâprovides that, without admitting or denying the Commissionâs allegations, Moore would agree to issuance of a Final Judgment ordering him make reimbursement of $450,000 to Symmetry.  The Commission further announced that, separately, it has instituted and simultaneously settled administrative proceedings against two Associate Chartered Accountants in the United Kingdom, Christopher J. Kelly and Margaret Hebb nÃ©e Whyte, who were the former audit partner and audit manager, respectively, on Ernst &amp; Young UK LLPâs audits of TPC for the 2004 through 2006 fiscal years (in the case of Kelly) and for the 2005 and 2006 fiscal years (in the case of Hebb). Kelly and Hebb consented to issuance of the Commissionâs Order and the sanctions it imposed, without admitting or denying the Orderâs findings. The Order found that both Kelly and Hebb engaged in improper professional conduct by, among other things, failing to properly audit TPCâs accounts receivable balances and inventory. Based on these findings, the Order suspended both Kelly and Hebb from appearing or practicing before the Commission as accountants, with the opportunity to seek reinstatement after two years. See Matter of Christopher J. Kelly, ACA and Margaret Hebb, ACA, Admin. Proc. File No. 3-____ (Jan. 30 )  Finally, the Commission further announced that, separately, it has instituted and simultaneously settled administrative proceedings against Symmetry and its CFO, Fred L. Hite. Symmetry and Hite consented to issuance of the Commissionâs Order and the sanctions it imposed, without admitting or denying the Orderâs findings. With respect to Symmetry, the Order found that, as a result of the fraud at TPC, Symmetry (i) filed periodic reports with the Commission that included materially false and misleading financial statements in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 and (ii) maintained materially inaccurate books, records and accounts in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(a); and that Symmetry also failed to devise and maintain effective internal accounting controls in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(B). With respect to Hite, the Order found that by failing to provide an internal audit status report concerning TPC to Symmetryâs Audit Committee in July 2006, Hite violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and was a cause of Symmetryâs violation of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(B); and that by failing to reimburse Symmetry for bonuses, incentive- and equity-based compensation, and Symmetry stock-sale proceeds he received during periods embraced by Symmetryâs restatement, Hite violated Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Based on the foregoing findings, the Commission ordered Symmetry and Hite to cease-and-desist from committing or causing future violations of the relevant provisions, and ordered Hite to pay a $25,000 penalty and make reimbursement of $185,000 to Symmetry.

"  SEC v. First Resource Group LLC, and David H. Stern, Civil Action No. 0:12-CV-60137-KMW (S.D. Fla., filed Jan. 26 )  SEC Charges Boiler Room Operators In Florida-Based Penny Stock Manipulation Scheme  The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today announced a civil action against First Resource Group LLC and its principal David H. Stern alleging that they fraudulently touted stock in two thinly-traded microcap companies, sold each companyâs stock at the same time they were touting it, and manipulated the markets in both penny stocks in violation of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. According to the SECâs complaint, at various times from December 2008 to May 2010 First Resource and Stern, and telemarketers they employed, fraudulently solicited brokers to purchase stock in TrinityCare Senior Living, Inc. and Cytta Corporation. The complaint alleges that while First Resource and Stern were recommending the purchase of the securities of the two microcap companies, Stern sold First Resourceâs shares of TrinityCare and Cytta unbeknownst to the investors who were purchasing the stocks, a practice known as scalping. Further, the complaint alleges that while Stern was selling the stocks, he was also purchasing small amounts of the stocks in order to create the false appearance of legitimate trading activity to induce the investors to purchase shares in both companies. The SEC also alleges that Stern and First Resource acted as unregistered broker-dealers.  The SECâs complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges First Resource Group and Stern with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In its complaint, the Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants, and a penny stock bar against Stern.  The SECâs investigation is continuing.   SEC Complaint   &nbsp;  http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22240.htm     Home | Previous Page Modified: 01/26/2012",

Rogers, Steven D. Hotovec, Joshua A. Klein, Yisroel M. Wachs, Frank K. McDonald, and Douglas G. Frederick  SEC CHARGES LATVIAN TRADER IN PERVASIVE BROKERAGE ACCOUNT HIJACKING SCHEME  SEC Also Charges 12 Firms and Individuals For Extending Market Access Without Registering as Brokers  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a trader in Latvia for conducting a widespread online account intrusion scheme in which he manipulated the prices of more than 100 NYSE and Nasdaq securities and caused more than $2 million in harm to customers of U.S. brokerage firms.  The SEC also instituted related administrative proceedings today against four electronic trading firms and eight executives charged with enabling the trader&rsquo;s scheme by allowing him anonymous and unfiltered access to the U.S. markets.  According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint filed in federal court in San Francisco, Igors Nagaicevs broke into online brokerage accounts of customers at large U.S. broker-dealers and drove stock prices up or down by making unauthorized purchases or sales in the hijacked accounts. This occurred on more than 150 occasions over the course of 14 months. Nagaicevs &ndash; using the direct, anonymous market access provided to him by various unregistered firms &ndash; traded those same securities at artificial prices and reaped more than $850,000 in illegal profits.  According to the SEC&rsquo;s orders instituting administrative proceedings against the four electronic trading firms, they allowed Nagaicevs to trade through their electronic platforms without first registering as brokers. Each of the trading firms provided him online access to trade directly in the U.S. markets through an account held in the firm&rsquo;s name. These firms gave Nagaicevs a gateway to the U.S. securities markets while circumventing the protections of the federal securities laws, including requirements for brokers to maintain and follow adequate procedures to gather information about customers and their trading.  The electronic trading firms and individuals named in the SEC&rsquo;s administrative proceedings are:   Alchemy Ventures, Inc. of San Mateo, Calif.  Mark H. Rogers, the firm&rsquo;s president, who lives in San Carlos, Calif. Steven D. Hotovec, the firm&rsquo;s vice president, who lives in Redwood City, Calif.

Frederick, an associate of the firm, who lives in Brighton, Mich.    Mercury Capital, Hyatt, and Rizzo each agreed to a settlement in which they consented to SEC orders finding that they willfully committed or aided and abetted and caused violations of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;). Hyatt and Rizzo each agreed to pay a $35,000 penalty.  The SEC&rsquo;s administrative action will determine whether the non-settling trading firms and principals willfully violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act, or whether the non-settling principals willfully aided and abetted and caused violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act, and what sanctions, if any, are appropriate as a result. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges that Nagaicevs violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties.

"  Accounting and Auditing Release No. 3356 / January 25   SEC v. Len A Familant and Paul V. Greene, Defendants, Civil Action No. 1:12-CV-00119-JEB (U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, January 25 )   SEC Brings Fraud Charges Against Former InPhonic Senior Vice President and President of Americas Premiere Corporation  On January 25 , the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;Commission&#8221;) filed a civil injunctive action against a former senior vice president and a vendor of InPhonic, Inc., a now-bankrupt online retailer of cellular phones that was headquartered in Washington, D.C.  According to the Commission&#8217;s complaint, from late 2005 through early 2007, Len A. Familant, then an InPhonic senior vice president, and Paul V. Greene, president of telephone supplier Americas Premiere Corporation (&#8220;APC&#8221;), engaged in a fraudulent scheme involving a series of &#8220;round-trip transactions&#8221; to artificially inflate InPhonic&#8217;s financial results.    The Commission&#8217;s complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges:    After the end of the third quarter of 2005 and each quarter in 2006, but before InPhonic reported its financial results, Familant obtained a total of almost $10 million in sham credits from APC and Greene.  Familant and Greene entered into an unwritten, undisclosed agreement that InPhonic would repay APC by purchasing cellular telephones and repair services from APC at inflated prices and by paying for fake repairs.&nbsp;  InPhonic improperly recorded the false credits from APC as a decrease in cost of goods sold.  InPhonic subsequently made repayments to APC in the form of overpayments for cellular telephones, repair services and fake repairs.&nbsp;  The round-trip scheme agreed to and implemented by Familant and Greene resulted in material understatements of InPhonic&#8217;s net loss (between 7% and 55%) in quarterly and annual filings with the Commission and material overstatements of InPhonic&#8217;s adjusted EBITDA in earnings releases from 2005-2007.&nbsp;  Familant and Greene concealed the fraudulent round-trip scheme.  For instance, together they identified particular telephone models APC could provide to InPhonic at inflated prices without raising suspicion.&nbsp;  Greene hid the round-trip scheme from InPhonic&#8217;s independent auditors even after APC&#8217;s accountant had informed Greene that APC&#8217;s sham credit transactions with InPhonic were illegal.&nbsp;  Familant encouraged APC to hide its billing for phony services after Familant learned that APC&#8217;s accountant had told Greene, &#8220;[w]e cannot do that.  That is fraud. . . .&#8221;&nbsp;  In October 2007, as InPhonic&#8217;s business was failing and after APC had been unable to fully recoup the credits, Greene sent an email to himself outlining a proposed lawsuit against InPhonic.  Greene referred to &#8220;the fake credits that were negotiated with INPC that they were using to hit certain quarterly numbers.&#8221;    Greene is charged with violating, and aiding and abetting InPhonic&#8217;s and Familant&#8217;s violations, of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(a) and (c).  Greene is also charged with violating the books and records provision of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and with aiding and abetting InPhonic&#8217;s violations of the reporting and books and records provisions of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13.  The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement, civil penalties and prejudgment interest against Greene.    Familant has agreed to settle the Commission&#8217;s charges without admitting or denying the allegations against him.  Familant has consented to a final judgment enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(a) and (c), and the books and records provision of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and from aiding and abetting InPhonic&#8217;s violations of the reporting and books and records provisions of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13.  Familant also has agreed to pay a $50,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The proposed settlement with Familant is subject to the approval of the District Court.

SEC CHARGES FORMER LOAN OFFICER WITH OAK HILL FINANCIAL, INC. AND THREE OTHERS WITH INSIDER TRADING   The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged four people with insider trading in the securities of Oak Hill Financial, Inc. (&#8220;Oak Hill&#8221;) ahead of a July 20, 2007 announcement that Oak Hill would be acquired by WesBanco, Inc. (Nasdaq: WSBC).  The Commission alleges that Robert Ward, who at the time was a loan officer at Oak Hill, tipped his friend, Benjamin Lewis, about the anticipated merger.  Benjamin Lewis then tipped his father, Stanley Lewis, who then tipped his daughter, Jamie Lewis.  The Lewises made approximately $100,000 from their illegal trading in Oak Hill.  The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.  The complaint alleges that:  Robert Ward knowingly or recklessly tipped his childhood friend Benjamin Lewis about an imminent merger between Oak Hill and WesBanco.  Benjamin Lewis tipped his father, Stanley Lewis, who then tipped his daughter, Jamie Lewis.  The Lewises began purchasing Oak Hill stock.  All total, Benjamin Lewis, Stanley Lewis and Jamie Lewis realized illicit profits of approximately $108,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the four settling defendants have offered to settle the case by consenting to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 and agreed to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties totaling more than $230,000 as follows:  Benjamin Lewis will pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $50,209.77.  Stanley Lewis will pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $54,715.77.  Jamie Lewis will pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $17,564.70.  Robert Ward is jointly and severally liable with the Lewises for disgorgement and prejudgment interest, all of which has been waived based on a demonstrated inability to pay.

AND TWO OTHERS WITH INSIDER TRADING  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three people with insider trading in the securities of Oak Hill Financial, Inc. (&#8220;Oak Hill&#8221;) ahead of a July 20, 2007 announcement that Oak Hill would be acquired by WesBanco, Inc. (Nasdaq: WSBC).  The Commission alleges Dale Shafer, who at the time was Oak Hill&#8217;s interim CFO, shared information with his cousin, Jason Gonski, about the anticipated merger.  Gonski purchased Oak Hill stock in his account and another account and made approximately $35,500 in illicit profits.  In addition, Gonski tipped his friend Joseph Mroz, and the two men together made approximately $15,099 from illegal trading in Oak Hill stock.  The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.  The complaint alleges that:  Shafer learned of the planned merger on May 14, 2007, and told Gonski about it.  Gonski misappropriated the information by trading on it.  He later told Shafer that he bought Oak Hill stock.  Shafer did not tell Gonski to stop trading and did not tell anyone at Oak Hill what had happened.  Over the next several weeks, Shafer continued to provide material, nonpublic information about the merger to Gonski and during this time period, Gonski substantially increased his position in Oak Hill.  Gonski also tipped his friend Mroz, and they both bought shares of Oak Hill using Mroz&#8217;s brokerage account.  Total profits in the accounts Gonski traded in were approximately $50,000, which includes $15,099 in profits from trading in the account of Mroz.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Shafer, Gonski and Mroz have offered to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The three settling defendants have agreed to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties totaling more than $150,000, as follows:  Gonski will pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $59,565.24 for which Shafer is jointly and severally liable for $38,957.81 of that amount and Mroz is jointly and severally liable for $8,766.74.  Gonski will pay a civil penalty of $50,686.38.  Shafer will pay a civil penalty of $33,484.08.  Mroz will pay a civil penalty of $7,459.95.  In addition, Shafer has agreed to be barred for five years from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company.  Shafer has also consented to the issuance of an order under Rule 102(e)(3) suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant with a right to apply for reinstatement after five years.

"  SEC v. Spyridon Adondakis, Anthony Chiasson, Sandeep Goyal, Jon Horvath, Danny Kuo, Todd Newman, Jesse Tortora, Diamondback Capital Management, LLC, and Level Global Investors, L.P., Civil Action 12-CV-0409 (SDNY)(PGG)  SEC Charges Seven Fund Managers and Analysts In Insider Trading Scheme, and Also Charges Hedge Fund Firms Diamondback Capital and Level Global  On January 18 , the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging two multi-billion dollar hedge fund advisory firms as well as seven fund managers and analysts involved in a $78 million insider trading scheme based on nonpublic information about Dell&#8217;s quarterly earnings and other similar inside information about Nvidia Corporation.    The charges stem from the SEC&#8217;s ongoing investigation into the trading activities of hedge funds.  The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the same seven individuals.  The SEC alleges that a network of closely associated hedge fund traders at Stamford, Conn.-based Diamondback Capital Management LLC and Greenwich, Conn.-based Level Global Investors LP illegally obtained the material nonpublic information about Dell and Nvidia.  Investment analyst Sandeep &#8220;Sandy&#8221; Goyal of Princeton, N.J., obtained Dell quarterly earnings information and other performance data from an insider at Dell in advance of earnings announcements in 2008.  Goyal tipped Diamondback analyst Jesse Tortora of Pembroke Pines, Fla., with the inside information, and Tortora in turn tipped several others, leading to insider trades on behalf of Diamondback and Level Global hedge funds.  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, the illicit gains in the Dell insider trades exceeded $62.3 million, and the illicit gains in the Nvidia insider trades exceeded $15.7 million.  For his role in the scheme, Goyal was paid $175,000 in soft dollar payments that were deposited in a brokerage account of an individual affiliated with him.  The SEC alleges that after obtaining the inside information from Goyal in advance of Dell&#8217;s first and second quarter earnings announcements in 2008, Tortora tipped his portfolio manager at Diamondback, Todd Newman of Needham, Mass.  Newman traded on the information on behalf of the Diamondback hedge funds he controlled.  Tortora also tipped Spyridon &#8220;Sam&#8221; Adondakis, an analyst at Level Global.  Adondakis tipped his manager Anthony Chiasson, who then traded on the inside information on behalf of Level Global hedge funds.  During this time period, both Adondakis and Chiasson lived in New York City.  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, Tortora also tipped two others at firms other than Diamondback or Level Global with the Dell inside information: Jon Horvath of New York City and Danny Kuo of San Marino, Calif.  Horvath caused insider trades at his firm that resulted in approximately $1.4 million of illicit gains.  Kuo similarly caused the firm where he worked to execute profitable insider trades in Dell securities.    The SEC further alleges that Kuo also obtained inside information about Nvidia Corporation&#8217;s calculation of its revenues, gross profit margins, and other financial metrics in advance of the company&#8217;s first quarter 2010 earnings announcements, which was made in May 2009.  Kuo again caused his firm to trade on inside information.  Kuo&#8217;s insider trades in Dell and Nvidia resulted in approximately $270,000 in ill-gotten gains.  Kuo also tipped Tortora at Diamondback and Adondakis at Level Global with the nonpublic information about Nvidia.  Tortora again tipped Newman, who made more insider trades on behalf of the Diamondback hedge funds.  The illegal trades in Dell and Nvidia securities resulted in $3.9 million in illicit gains for Diamondback.  At Level Global, Adondakis tipped Chiasson who made the insider trades on behalf of those hedge funds.  Chiasson&#8217;s insider trades in Dell and Nvidia resulted in approximately $72.6 million of illicit gains for the Level Global hedge funds.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint charges each of the defendants with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and, additionally, charges Goyal, Tortora, Newman, Adondakis, Chiasson, Horvath and Kuo with aiding and abetting others&#8217; violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint seeks a final judgment ordering the defendants to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, ordering them to pay financial penalties, and permanently enjoining them from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws.

"  SEC V. BANKATLANTIC BANCORP., INC. AND ALAN LEVAN (UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA, CASE NO. 0:12-CV60082, FILED JANUARY 18 )  On January 18 , The Securities and Exchange Commission filed securities fraud charges against BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc. (at the time of its misconduct the holding company for BankAtlantic, one of Florida&#8217;s largest banks) (&#8220;Bancorp&#8221; or &#8220;the bank&#8221;) and its Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Alan Levan, with securities fraud intended to hide growing problems early in the financial crisis.  The SEC&#8217;s civil complaint alleges that (1) Bancorp and Levan made misleading statements in public filings and earnings calls regarding the deteriorating state of a large portion of Bancorp&#8217;s commercial real estate portfolio in the first two quarters of 2007; and (2) Bancorp and Levan improperly accounted for loans they were trying to sell from this portfolio in late 2007 to minimize Bancorp&#8217;s losses.    The SEC&#8217;s complaint, filed in the Southern District of Florida, alleges that Bancorp and Levan knew that a large portion of the commercial residential portfolio was deteriorating early in 2007 due to the fact that many of the loans had required extensions because of the borrowers&#8217; inability to meet their loan obligations.  A number of loans were kept &#8220;current&#8221; only by extending the terms or replenishment of the interest reserves from an increase in the loan principal.  Levan knew this negative information in part from participating in the bank&#8217;s Major Loan Committee (which approved the extensions and principal increases).  Bancorp and Levan were also aware that many of the loans had been internally downgraded to non-passing status, indicating the bank was deeply concerned about the loans.    Despite this knowledge, Bancorp&#8217;s public filings in the first two quarters of 2007 made only generic warnings of what may occur in the future if Florida&#8217;s real estate downturn continued and failed to disclose the downward trend already occurring in its own portfolio.  The steady deterioration of this portfolio constituted a known trend of the type that should have been disclosed in the Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis (&#8220;MD&amp;A&#8221;) of Bancorp&#8217;s periodic filings, which were signed by Levan.  Levan also made misleading statements to investors about the portfolio during earnings calls in the same time period.  Bancorp finally acknowledged the problem in the third quarter of 2007 by announcing a large unexpected loss.      The SEC also alleges that Bancorp and Levan attempted to sell a number of the deteriorating loans after this announcement but failed to account for them properly as being &#8220;held for sale&#8221; as required by GAAP because doing so would have required Bancorp to write them down, incurring immediate additional losses.  As a result of this scheme, Bancorp understated its net loss by more than 10% in its 2007 Form 10-K.    The complaint charges Bancorp with violating, and Levan with violating and aiding and abetting, the antifraud provisions in Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Bancorp with violating, and Levan with aiding and abetting, the reporting provisions in Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder; and Levan with violating the falsification of books and records, lying to accountants, and certification provisions in Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 13a-14(a) thereunder.  The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay financial penalties, and also seeks an officer and director bar against Levan.

"  SEC v. Burton Douglas Morriss, et al., Case No. 4:12-cv-00080-CEJ (U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri)  SEC CHARGES ST. LOUIS-BASED PRIVATE INVESTMENT FUNDS AND THEIR PRINCIPAL WITH FRAUD AND OBTAINS EMERGENCY RELIEF AGAINST THE ENTITIES  The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has filed charges and obtained emergency relief, including an asset freeze and the appointment of a receiver, against several St. Louis, Missouri private investment funds and management companies. The SEC alleges that Burton Douglas Morriss, the principal of these entities, misappropriated over $9 million of investor assets.  The SEC alleges that Morriss told investors that his private investment funds and management companies would invest their money in a portfolio of financial services and technology companies. However, investors were unaware that for the past several years, Morriss had been misappropriating their money to the tune of millions of dollars through a series of fraudulent transfers to himself and another entity he controlled. To conceal his fraud, Morriss later disguised these fraudulent transfers as personal loans.  According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, at various times between approximately 2003 and 2011, Morriss, his two private investment funds, MIC VII, LLC and Acartha Technology Partners, LP, and his management firms, Gryphon Investments III, LLC and Acartha Group, LLC, raised at least $88 million from at least 97 investors to invest in preferred shares or membership interests in the defendant entities. The defendants represented to investors that the investment funds would invest in early to mid-stage companies in the financial services and technology sectors.  The SEC alleges that unbeknownst to investors, for the past several years, Morriss has misappropriated investor funds through transfers from his companies to himself and another entity he controlled, Morriss Holdings, LLC, to pay for personal expenses, including, mortgage and alimony payments, payment of personal loans, pleasure trips, and household expenses. In an attempt to conceal his scheme, the fraudulent transfers that Morriss made to himself were recorded as âloansâ on the defendant entitiesâ books. In fact, these transfers were never truly loans because Morriss did not intend to repay them at the time of his misappropriation. Moreover, the funds transferred to Morriss for his personal use were inconsistent with the disclosures contained in the offering materials provided to investors.  The SECâs complaint also alleges that Morriss concocted a scheme to recruit new investors to purchase membership interests in one of his private investment funds without the unanimous consent of existing investors, as required. This diluted the investments of the fundâs existing investors.  On January 17 , the Honorable Carol E. Jackson granted the SECâs request for asset freezes, the appointment of a receiver over the entity defendants, and other emergency relief to prevent further dissipation of investor assets. The SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief and financial penalties against Morriss and the entity defendants, as well as disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains from them and the relief defendant Morriss Holdings, LLC. The SEC also seeks an officer-and-director bar against Morriss. In addition, the SECâs action names Morriss Holdings, LLC as a relief defendant.  The SECâs complaint charges:   Morriss with violations of Section 17(a)(1), (2), and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (âSecurities Actâ) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, his aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, and his violations or, in the alternative, aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (âAdvisers Actâ) and Rule 206(4)-8(a)(2);   Acartha Group and Gryphon III with violations of Section 17(a)(1), (2), and (3) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(a),(b), and (c) thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8(a)(2), thereunder; and   MIC VII and ATP with violations of Section 17(a)(1), (2), and (3) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(a), (b), and (c) thereunder.

"  United States Securities Exchange Commission v. Farzin Bazshushtari, United States District Court for the Central District of California, Civil Action No. CV12-00354GHX  SEC CHARGES SALES DIRECTOR WITH INSIDER TRADING IN COMPANY SECURITIES   The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a sales director at Santa Ana, Calif.-based data storage manufacturer STEC Inc. with insider trading in company securities based on non-public information he learned on the job.    The SEC&rsquo;s complaint filed on January 13  in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, alleges that Farzin Bazshushtari, who lives in Mission Viejo and is STEC&rsquo;s Director of Industrial Distribution, purchased 7,000 STEC shares on April 27, 2009, after learning about STEC&rsquo;s positive first quarter financial results. When those results were announced publicly on May 11, STEC&rsquo;s stock price jumped 30 percent.    The SEC further alleges that Bazshushtari purchased another 5,500 shares on May 27, 2009, after seeing internal weekly sales reports indicating that STEC would outperform second quarter guidance. He additionally purchased 200 STEC call options on June 10. When the company publicly increased second quarter revenue guidance on June 16 to reflect the surging sales, STEC&rsquo;s stock price jumped 26 percent.    According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Bazshushtari made total profits of $76,676.50 by trading on inside information. Bazshushtari knew that he violated company policies when he placed the trades. His April 27 purchase was made during a &ldquo;blackout&rdquo; period when STEC employees were prohibited from trading in company stock. He purchased STEC call options despite STEC employees being prohibited from trading in STEC options, which give holders the right to buy or sell shares in the future. Bazshushtari further violated STEC&rsquo;s written insider trading and ethics policies when he traded on margin and held his STEC securities in a margin account.    Bazshushtari agreed to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges by paying $76,676.50 in disgorgement and a $76,676.50 penalty. Bazshushtari also has consented without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s allegations to a permanent injunction from further violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority.

Imperiali, Inc., Daniel Imperato, Charles Fiscina, and Lawrence OâDonnell Civil Action No. 9:12-cv-80021 (S.D. Fla.)(January 9 )  SEC Charges Issuer, Officers and Auditor with Fraud  On January 9 , the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Florida-based Imperiali, Inc., one current and one former officer, and its former auditor for their involvement in a fraudulent disclosure and accounting scheme.  The SECâs Complaint alleges that between 2005 and 2008, Daniel Imperato orchestrated a scheme to use Imperiali, a business development company that Imperato owned and controlled, to defraud investors by making it appear that Imperiali was a thriving multinational corporation with several wholly-owned businesses, when in fact it was nothing more than a shell corporation. The Complaint alleges that Imperiali raised approximately $2.5 million using offering materials that included numerous material misrepresentations and omissions, and that Imperato and Fiscina drafted, reviewed, and certified at least 16 materially false and misleading registration statements, periodic reports and current reports with the Commission on behalf of Imperiali. Among other things, the Complaint alleges that those filings overvalued Imperialiâs virtually worthless assets at amounts ranging from $3.5 million to $269 million, and failed to disclose the issuance of millions of shares of restricted stock. The Complaint also alleges that OâDonnell failed to audit Imperialiâs financial statements in accordance with Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Standards, and issued audit reports on Imperialiâs financial statements that he knew or was reckless in not knowing contained materially false and misleading information.  The SECâs complaint charges that Imperiali and Imperato violated, or aided and abetted violations of, Sections 5(a), 5(a), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder; that Imperiali also violated Sections 18(d), 31(a), and 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment Company Act) and rule 31a-1 thereunder; that Imperato also violated Sections 13(b)(5) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act and rules 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 13a-14 thereunder, and Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act; and that OâDonnell violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions and civil penalties from each defendant, disgorgement with prejudgment interest from Imperiali and Imperato, and an officer and director bar against Imperato, and Fiscina.  Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, Fiscina has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 13a-14 thereunder, and Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder, and bars him from acting as an officer or director of a public company. The Fiscina final judgment does not impose a civil penalty against him based on his sworn inability to pay. The settlement is subject to the Courtâs approval.

"  Accounting and Auditing Release No. 3353 / January 10   Securities and Exchange Commission v. Todd Farha, et al., Civil Action No. 8:12-cv-00047-SDM-MAP (M.D. Fla., January 9 )  SEC BRINGS FRAUD AND INSIDER TRADING CHARGES AGAINST THREE FORMER WELLCARE EXECUTIVES  On January 9 , the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;Commission&#8221;) filed a civil injunctive action against three former executives of WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (&#8220;WellCare&#8221;), a managed care services company that administers federal government-sponsored health care programs.  According to the Commission&#8217;s complaint, from 2003 to 2007, Todd Farha, former Chief Executive Officer, Paul Behrens, former Chief Financial Officer, and Thaddeus Bereday, former General Counsel, (collectively, &#8220;the Defendants&#8221;), devised and carried out a fraudulent scheme that deceived the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (&#8220;AHCA&#8221;) and the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation (&#8220;Healthy Kids&#8221;) by improperly retaining over $40 million in health care premiums the company was statutorily and contractually obligated to spend on certain health care services or reimburse to the state agencies.  As a result of the scheme, WellCare recorded the retained amount as revenue, which materially inflated its net income and diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) in its public financial statements.    As alleged in the complaint, WellCare received premiums from AHCA and Healthy Kids that WellCare was required, by contract and by statute, to spend on certain eligible health care services for low-income plan participants.  If WellCare spent less than a certain percentage of the premiums on eligible health care services, it was required to refund some or all of the difference to the State of Florida.  According to the complaint, the Defendants devised a scheme to evade the state&#8217;s regulatory framework and fraudulently retain the premiums by, among other methods, funneling the premiums through an internal subsidiary and by applying administrative and other non-allowable expenses in their calculation of money spent on health care services.  In total, through their fraudulent conduct, the complaint alleges that WellCare reduced the refunds it paid to AHCA by approximately $35 million and to Healthy Kids by approximately $6 million.     The excess premiums retained by the Defendants went straight to WellCare&#8217;s bottom line.  WellCare materially misstated its net income and EPS in filings with the Commission and in quarterly and annual earnings releases from 2004-2006 and the first two quarters of 2007.  On January 26, 2009, WellCare filed its Form 10-K for 2007 and restated its financial results for those time periods.  The Restatement reduced WellCare&#8217;s reported net income and EPS by approximately 14% for fiscal year (&#8220;FY&#8221;) 2004, 9% for FY 2005, 13% for FY 2006, and 9% for the first quarter of FY 2007.    The Commission&#8217;s complaint also alleges that, after setting their fraudulent scheme in motion, the Defendants sold approximately 1.6 million WellCare shares into the public market for gross proceeds of approximately $91 million.  The Commission alleges that the Defendants sold these shares on the basis of the material, nonpublic information that they were conducting a fraudulent scheme that impacted WellCare&#8217;s financial results, caused false and misleading statements, and imperiled the Company&#8217;s business relationship with the State of Florida.  According to the complaint, the Defendants sold the shares pursuant to 10b5-1 trading plans that were created and amended in bad faith, and through three public stock offerings conducted while the scheme was ongoing.    Based on the conduct alleged in the complaint, the Commission charges that each of the Defendants violated antifraud provisions Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (&#8220;Securities Act&#8221;) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and also violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.  All of the Defendants are also charged with aiding and abetting WellCare&#8217;s violations of reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions, namely, Sections (13)(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13.  Bereday is charged with aiding and abetting Farha&#8217;s and Behrens&#8217; violations of antifraud provisions Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) of the Exchange Act.  Finally, Farha and Behrens are charged with violating Exchange Act Rules 13b2-2 and 13a-14, and Section 304(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley, which requires that the CEO or CFO of a company that restates its financial results to reimburse the company any incentive-based or equity-based compensation received and any profits realized from the sale of the company&#8217;s stock during the 12-month period following initial issuance of the misleading financial statements.    As to each Defendant, the Commission is seeking a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the provisions of the securities laws specified above, civil penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and officer and director bars.  As to Farha and Behrens, the Commission seeks reimbursement of incentive-based and equity-based compensation pursuant to Section 304(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley.    In conducting its investigation, the Commission acknowledges assistance from the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Middle District of Florida, the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

"  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 3352 / January 4   Securities and Exchange Commission v. JBI, Inc., John Bordynuik and Ronald Baldwin, Jr., Civil Action No. 1:12-cv-10012, United States District Court, District of Massachusetts  SEC CHARGES COMPANY AND ITS OFFICERS WITH ACCOUNTING FRAUD  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed an action in federal court in Massachusetts against JBI, Inc., a publicly-traded company formerly located in Massachusetts and now headquartered in Ontario, Canada. The Commission also charged JBIâs current CEO, John Bordynuik, a resident of Ontario, Canada, and its former CFO, Ronald Baldwin, Jr, a resident of Palm Harbor, Florida. The action alleges that the defendants engaged in a scheme to commit securities and accounting fraud by reporting materially false and inaccurate financial information on the financial statements of JBI, Inc. for two reporting periods during 2009.  According to the Commissionâs complaint, JBI is purportedly a technology company focused on data restoration and recovery and environmentally engineered product development. The company is headquartered in Canada, but purportedly has operations in New York, Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The complaint alleges that JBI is purportedly also involved in the research and development of a process designed to convert plastic waste into oil, known as âPlastic2Oilâ or âP2Oâ. The Commission alleges that during the third quarter of 2009 and the year end 2009, JBI materially overstated certain assets in an effort to bolster its balance sheet and success in two private capital raising efforts (Private Investment in Public Equity or PIPES) geared toward raising the capital necessary to begin commercial operation and production of P2O. The Complaint alleges that JBI raised over $8.4 million for the company in these PIPES just before the company issued a public statement indicating its financial statements could no longer be relied upon, in part, due to the erroneous valuation of certain assets, known as media credits, on the balance sheet.  The Commission alleges that in contravention of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (âGAAPâ), the company erroneously booked the media credits at a value of $9.997 million, thereby becoming the single largest asset on the companyâs balance sheet, when they should have been initially booked at a value of $1,000,000 when acquired in August 2009, and subsequently, the media credits should have been remeasured at their current value and written down to zero as of the end of the companyâs third fiscal quarter on September 30, 2009. According to the complaint, Bordynuik was aware of, or was reckless in not being aware of, GAAP concerns surrounding the reported value of the media credits in advance of the companyâs third quarter 2009 Form 10-Q filing with the Commission on November 16, 2009 and the year end 2009 Form 10-K filing with the Commission on March 31, 2010 yet falsely certified that the companyâs financial statements for those reporting periods were filed in conformity with GAAP. The Commission complaint further alleges that Baldwin was aware of, or was reckless in not being aware of, GAAP concerns surrounding the reported value of the media credits in advance of the companyâs year-end 2009 10-K filing on March 31, 2010, yet falsely certified that the companyâs financial statements for that period were filed in conformity with GAAP.  The Commissionâs complaint charges JBI, Inc. with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (âSecurities Actâ) and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder. The complaint alleges that Bordynuik violated Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, and Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act. In addition, the Commissionâs complaint alleges that Baldwin violated Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, and Section 13(b)(5). Finally, the complaint alleges that Bordynuik and Baldwin violated directly or aided and abetted JBIâs violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 (Bordynuik only), 13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 (Bordynuik only). In its complaint, the Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against all three defendants, and officer and director bars against Bordynuik and Baldwin.

"  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chalmer E. Detling, II, Esq., Civil Action No. 1:11 cv 4565, United States District Court, Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division  SEC CHARGES ATLANTA-BASED ATTORNEY WITH FRAUD IN THE OFFER AND SALE OF MUNICIPAL BONDS  The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced its filing of a civil injunctive action alleging fraud in the offer and sale of municipal bonds by Chalmer E. Detling, II, an attorney based in Atlanta.  Filed December 29, 2011 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, the SECâs complaint alleges that Detling made material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the 2006 offer and sale of $2.96 million of industrial development revenue bonds. Raleigh County, West Virginia issued the bonds in October 2006 to facilitate Aiken Continental, L.L.C.âs acquisition of Continental Casket, Inc., a casket manufacturing facility located within its jurisdiction. In 2006, Detling served as counsel to Aiken Continental and its sole principal, Charles A. Aiken, for purposes of the acquisition, and simultaneously represented Aiken in an unrelated federal criminal proceeding.  According to the SECâs complaint, Detling failed to disclose to key participants to the transaction, including the issuer, bond counsel, the underwriter, and the bondholdersâ trustee, that Aiken had been indicted for financial fraud in late 2005. Detling also failed to disclose that he was in the process of negotiating a plea agreement for Aiken just before the bonds were issued in October 2006. In addition, Detling failed to disclose material information about a $200,000 loan to Aiken and Aiken Continental from a company that was partially owned by Detling, in order to facilitate the closing of the transaction. This loan required a $100,000 interest payment, and gave the lender a twenty percent equity interest in Aiken Continental if the loan plus interest was not fully repaid within six months. Detlingâs failure to disclose details about Aikenâs criminal proceeding and the loan rendered certain statements in the bondsâ Official Statement materially misleading. By reviewing the Official Statement, which was distributed to investors in connection with the transaction, and failing to correct the misstatements and omissions therein, the SECâs complaint alleges that Detling aided and abetted the violations of Aiken and Aiken Continental.  In addition, the SECâs complaint alleges that Detling signed an opinion letter as counsel to Aiken Continental in which he made false and misleading representations. Specifically, Detling represented that no proceeding at law was pending which would adversely affect Aiken Continental, and that the Official Statement did not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit any material facts. The SECâs complaint alleges that these representations were materially false and misleading due to Detlingâs failures to disclose material information about Aikenâs criminal proceeding and the loan.  According to the SECâs complaint, Aiken served 90 days in federal prison and 90 days of home detention in Georgia following the close of the transaction. Aikenâs six-month absence negatively affected the operations of the casket company and the Raleigh County bonds are now in default, with the entire principal amount and accrued interest due.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Detling agreed to settle the SECâs charges by consenting to the entry of a final judgment, which will permanently enjoin him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. As part of the settlement, Detling also agreed to pay $10,000 in disgorgement, $3,052 in prejudgment interest, and a $25,000 civil penalty, all of which will be distributed on a pro rata basis to Raleigh County bondholders. The SECâs settlement with Detling is subject to court approval. In addition, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commissionâs Rules of Practice, Detling consented to the entry of an administrative order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney, with the right to reapply after five years.

"  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Charles A. Aiken, et al., Civil Action No. CA 5:11-1018, United States District Court, Southern District of West Virginia  SEC CHARGES CHARLES A. AIKEN AND AIKEN CONTINENTAL, L.L.C. WITH FRAUD IN THE OFFER AND SALE OF MUNICIPAL BONDS  The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced its filing of a civil injunctive action alleging fraud in the offer and sale of municipal bonds by Charles A. Aiken and his entity, Aiken Continental, L.L.C.  Filed December 29, 2011 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, the SECâs complaint alleges that Aiken and Aiken Continental made material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the 2006 offer and sale of $2.96 million of industrial development revenue bonds. Raleigh County, West Virginia issued the bonds in October 2006 to facilitate Aiken Continentalâs acquisition of Continental Casket, Inc., a casket manufacturing facility located within its jurisdiction. Aiken formed Aiken Continental in August 2006 for the sole purpose of acquiring Continental Casketâs assets, and served as its sole principal.  According to the SECâs complaint, Aiken concealed from key participants to the transaction, including the issuer, bond counsel, the underwriter, and the bondholdersâ trustee, that he had been indicted for felony financial fraud in late 2005. Aiken also concealed the fact that he was in the process of negotiating a plea agreement just before the bonds were issued in October 2006, which included a term of imprisonment. In addition, Aiken failed to disclose material information about a $200,000 loan to Aiken and Aiken Continental from an entity partially owned by their attorney, in order to facilitate the closing of the transaction. This loan required a $100,000 interest payment, and gave the lender a twenty percent equity interest in Aiken Continental if the loan plus interest was not fully repaid within six months. Aikenâs failure to disclose details about his criminal proceeding and the loan rendered certain statements in the bondsâ Official Statement materially misleading. For example, one section of the Official Statement contained information about Aikenâs background, but failed to mention his felony indictment for financial fraud. Another section of the Official Statement contained projected financial statements for Aiken Continental, but failed to take into account the repayment of the $200,000 loan plus $100,000 interest. Aiken Continental supplied and authorized the use of information in the Official Statement. Aiken signed the Official Statement on behalf of Aiken Continental, and authorized it to be distributed to investors.  According to the SECâs complaint, Aiken served 90 days in federal prison and 90 days of home detention in Georgia following the close of the transaction. Aikenâs six-month absence negatively affected the operations of the casket company and the Raleigh County bonds are now in default, with the entire principal amount and accrued interest due.
